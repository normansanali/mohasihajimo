The action is relentless, and the unsuspecting <a href=#>pot-enthusiast,</a> who until now had no memory of his violent past, suddenly finds himself the target of wave upon wave of trained operatives trying to kill him.</p><p>The 2015 film finds comedy in contrasting the peaceful small town and its resident protagonist with the blistering might of secret forces and government agencies.

The film makes use of multiple outdoor locations in the city to portray the fictional town of Liman, West Virginia, where the protagonist is ambushed by a horde of lethal government operatives hell-bent on “neutralizing” him.</p><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=419519 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/where-was-american-ultra-filmed/fireshot-capture-446-american-ultra-official-trailer-1-2015-jesse-eisenberg-kristen-_-www-youtube-com/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FireShot-Capture-446-American-Ultra-Official-Trailer-1-2015-Jesse-Eisenberg-Kristen-_-www.youtube.com_-e1625868696261.jpg data-orig-size=1297,652 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="FireShot Capture 446 – American Ultra Official Trailer #1 (2015) – Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen _ – www.youtube.com" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FireShot-Capture-446-American-Ultra-Official-Trailer-1-2015-Jesse-Eisenberg-Kristen-_-www.youtube.com_-e1625868696261.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FireShot-Capture-446-American-Ultra-Official-Trailer-1-2015-Jesse-Eisenberg-Kristen-_-www.youtube.com_-e1625868696261.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FireShot-Capture-446-American-Ultra-Official-Trailer-1-2015-Jesse-Eisenberg-Kristen-_-www.youtube.com_-e1625868696261.jpg alt width=1024 height=515 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jefferson Parish (Louisiana has parishes instead of counties), also located within Greater New Orleans, features heavily in the movie. The production crew filmed in the cities of Harahan and Kenner, as well as the census-designated area Metairie, all of which lie in Jefferson Parish.</p><h2>Other Locations in Louisiana</h2><p>Production for the action movie also took place in other parts of the state. As the protagonist escapes the lethal agents and attempts to get answers, he sets off on a turbulent journey. On-location filming took place in the towns of Lutcher and Gramercy, both of which are located in St. James Parish. The city of Covington in St. Tammany Parish was also used for filming.</p><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=419515 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/where-was-american-ultra-filmed/mv5bmzcwzjrlzgmtngi0mc00y2y3ltk2mwytowzmn2ixmjzjzwqzxkeyxkfqcgdeqxvynjg1otuxnzg-_v1_/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MV5BMzcwZjRlZGMtNGI0MC00Y2Y3LTk2MWYtOWZmN2IxMjZjZWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg1OTUxNzg@._V1_.jpg data-orig-size=1282,692 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=MV5BMzcwZjRlZGMtNGI0MC00Y2Y3LTk2MWYtOWZmN2IxMjZjZWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg1OTUxNzg@._V1_ data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MV5BMzcwZjRlZGMtNGI0MC00Y2Y3LTk2MWYtOWZmN2IxMjZjZWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg1OTUxNzg@._V1_.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MV5BMzcwZjRlZGMtNGI0MC00Y2Y3LTk2MWYtOWZmN2IxMjZjZWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg1OTUxNzg@._V1_.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MV5BMzcwZjRlZGMtNGI0MC00Y2Y3LTk2MWYtOWZmN2IxMjZjZWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg1OTUxNzg@._V1_.jpg alt width=1024 height=553 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The film also used some of the state’s larger cities to contrast the small town it opens with and depict Mike’s violent quest for answers. A portion of filming also took place in the city of Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish, as well as Houma in Terrebonne Parish. Both cities are the largest urban centers of their respective parishes.
