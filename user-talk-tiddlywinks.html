It doesn't give you what region their 3DS is from but it's at least a start. <a href=# title=User:Glik>Glik</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Glik">talk</a>) 23:25, 7 January 2014 (UTC) Yeah, I just happened to notice that on passerby today. It'd be a slow and complicated start, though. I'll probably try to ask people with foreign 3DS's before I try that. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 02:10, 8 January 2014 (UTC) Went through and added all the EU locations, hoping there's no typos but with 69 countries, about 750 individual locations and so many odd spellings I wouldn't be surprised if one or two slipped in... Surprisingly enough, apparently there's even a town called Batman in Turkey. <a href=# class=new title="User:Bluesun (page does not exist)">Bluesun</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Bluesun">talk</a>) 17:30, 22 January 2014 (UTC)<h2><span class=mw-headline id=South_Korea>South Korea</span></h2><p>Tiddlywinks, you forgot to add South Korea since a South Korean gamer found a Continental Pattern Vivillon. <a href=# title=User:Cinday123><span>Cinday123</span></a> <i>(<a href=# title="User talk:Cinday123"><span>Talk</span></a>)</i> 01:44, 7 January 2014 (UTC)</p>There are a lot of locations not on there. Like everywhere in Europe. I don't intend to add just one or two countries, though, especially when I can't be 100% sure which region they belong to. Like I said in the section above, what I really want is a list from someone with a non-NA 3DS, a list of all the locations their 3DS can be set to. Then I'll be happy to update, when I can add a whole and complete region. <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 02:43, 7 January 2014 (UTC)<h2><span class=mw-headline id=hey>hey</span></h2><p>very nice stuff, good sir. One day i would love to see the full world map all coloured out, even tho if some countries are left out but some places can be obvious like Cuba for Archipelgo. <a href=# title=User:Jason><span>-Mew Jadester</span></a><a href=# title="User talk:Jason"><span>-tp-</span></a> 13:43, 2 February 2014 (UTC) Hey tiddlywinks, its me again, i have used those extracted data you have gathered and i am working on to fill in all the gaps, its going pretty nicely. I will personally upload the map image (that would be all complete) and the data i have gathered. Its a shame that the owner of imgur have taken down the survey part so im left in the dark to finish it off myself anywwayts (not that bothers me since i dont have anything better to do and im knowledgable in geography) If u wanna contact me faster to get it, feel free to email me at mew.jadester (at) gmail.com. Cheers. <a href=# title=User:Jason><span>-Mew Jadester</span></a><a href=# title="User talk:Jason"><span>-tp-</span></a> 13:32, 3 February 2014 (UTC)</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Official_maps>Official maps</span></h2><p>Here are the Vivillon maps from the official Japanese guidebook, thanks to bluesun. <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>Page set 1</a>, <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>Page set 2</a>.

I imagine that would fit alright in the Archives.

But I believe you have a duplicate sublocation under Dominican Republic (Elias Pina) which is also throwing off your counts by one. <a href=# class=new title="User:SuperSmole (page does not exist)">SuperSmole</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:SuperSmole">talk</a>) 02:53, 9 January 2015 (UTC)</p>You're right. I'm not sure at this point, but I think I copied a bunch of locations from somewhere that closely matched 3DS locations, and then tried to check my American locations, but I guess I missed that duplicate. Or something. =P Thanks! <a href=# title=User:Tiddlywinks>Tiddlywinks</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Tiddlywinks">talk</a>) 03:08, 9 January 2015 (UTC)<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4rApr6%2BrZilo2qJtqWwy7KuoqabqHyXtdWio6WnnpS5sK%2FAraCopqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
