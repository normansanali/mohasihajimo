I am grateful for everything that has gotten me where I am today. This shows it’s very much possible, and the only limits you have is the ones you set for yourself. This is still the beginning of my journey, and I will continue my education by obtaining my MASTER DEGREE IN BUSINESS (MBA). I have already started the program and have a 4.0 GPA!”</p><p>What’s more, Shania is being recognized for raising the bar once again. She is now the youngest full-time teacher in U.S. <a href=# rel=noopener>history,</a> according to her father, Elijah, per a post on Facebook. She had previously completed a two-year professional development training program for <a href=# rel=noopener>teachers</a> through the Thurgood Marshall Foundation.</p><p>“I Am Super Proud To Announce That My 16 year Old Daughter Shania Shakura Muhammad is The Youngest Full Time Salaried Teacher In The United States!!! (Shania’s Teaching The Third Grade),” Elijah wrote on Facebook.</p><p>He added, “Beyond Her Long Resume and Professional Accolades, She Has A True Desire and Passion For Teaching!!! People Will Always Have Criticism And Negative Things To Say, but We Are Use To It and Not One Negative Comment has Slowed Down Our Family’s History Making Progress. I’m Super Proud Of My Daughter For Being Bold And Brave and Stepping Out On Her Faith and Into Her Purpose and Not Allowing Peoples Opinions Of Her To Dictate The Reality of Her Dreams and Passions.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Black News,</a> Shania will be teaching third graders in her <a href=# rel=noopener>hometown</a> of Oklahoma City, OK.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlqe8tbHCoWWcp51kwKmtzaKYZquYlri2vsBmpK6gkaK6orCMoqpmrJiaerq71KeenqukYrO2uMtmq6KllWLAorjAq6CenF2psqKvx56p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
