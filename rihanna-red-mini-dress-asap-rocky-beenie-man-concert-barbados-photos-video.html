The lovebirds, who share a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>six-month-old son</a> together, also dined at a European restaurant called Issima that night before they made their way to a shop for the delicious dessert. They both wore black leather outfits, including a jacket and pants for Rihanna and a jacket and jeans for Rocky.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>As Rihanna and Rocky continue to enjoy nights out together, a source recent told us that the “Umbrella” crooner has been able to find a way to balance motherhood and her career despite her busy lifestyle, and a lot of it is due to a “great team” she has behind her. “The secret to Rihanna being able to balance it all is the great team she has behind her in all areas and that includes Rocky; He’s her MVP,” a person close to the nine-time Grammy winner <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told<strong> HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY</a>. “He is such an amazing dad and partner to her; He is key in helping her do it all. And she has also built a very tight team of people around her that she trusts to help her keep every aspect of her work life under control so that she can devote most of her time to doing all the creative [tasks].”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FwZquhmJa7r62Mq5ydZZ2eu6p5w6ucrKtdlsCivIyrppyjqWKvprHNopxmpZGjeqS7zZycq6xdl66zrsCdpqxloJ28tbvSZq2inJWkfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
