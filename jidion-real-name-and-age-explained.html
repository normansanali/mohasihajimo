While fans are captivated by his engaging personality and shower his videos with love, one lingering curiosity about the real person behind the screen always bugs viewers.</p><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=758 data-injectable=true>The YouTube star has also been shrouded in various controversies that came along with his rise to fame. He was banned from the popular streaming platform Twitch in Jan. 2022 after he incited a hate raid on another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch streamer, Pokimane</a>. He also received a lifetime ban from all&nbsp;NBA&nbsp;and&nbsp;WNBA&nbsp;events for a stunt he pulled at a WNBA game in July 2023. While most people know him as this daring troublemaker, JiDion hides his real identity behind his “professional internet troll” personality.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://youtu.be/o0EXikiMhhc?si=9342IsjH2or1fgCZ</figure><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>The real identities and lives of actors, singers, YouTubers, and other famous people always pique the interest of fans. Like any other star shining bright in the spotlight, JiDion also has a life under the shadows. Beyond his captivating online persona and catchy channel name, here is who the real JiDion is and how old he is.</p><h2 id=h-jidion-s-real-name data-injectable=false>JiDion’s real name</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr3sJILurg_/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==</figure><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=true>JiDion is popularly known by his alias DeMarcus Cousins III&nbsp;or as JiDion itself. He used the moniker DeMarcus Cousins III as a result of an ongoing joke that he resembles Cousins owing to their comparable physical characteristics and facial hair style. However, unlike popular belief, it is not his real name. He has rarely used his real name in his videos or anywhere in his online presence including Instagram and other social media platforms.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>JiDion’s real name is Jidon Armani Adams, and he uses a creative version of his first name as his internet identity. He keeps his personal life mostly under wraps, and very little is known about his family members.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>JiDion’s age</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>https://youtu.be/FHLElYGLzgg?si=3YOoMMUalGTzRAdg</figure><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=false>Two months after creating his YouTube channel in July 2018, JiDion published his debut video in September of the same year. At that time, he was merely 17 years old and, as a newbie creator, initially not many people were tuning in to his channel. In the spring of 2019, his channel began to expand as a result of some of the videos he uploaded <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">receiving millions of views</a>. By the age of 20, he became quite famous and now, at 22 years old (at the time of this writing), enjoys a massive following. He was born on Dec. 12, 2000, in Houston, Texas, and will soon turn 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3qrDIqKVmqpWWuW66wKacZpmemXqis8RmnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
