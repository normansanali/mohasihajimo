Love lost his father, Orbin Jr., when he was just 14 years old. Love studied at Liberty High. By his senior year, he had been chosen the starter after being informed as a freshman that he could not play quarterback. Love rushed for 806 yards and eight touchdowns as a senior while also passing for 2,148 yards and 24 scores. A 2-star recruit, he chose Utah State over offers from Eastern Washington, Northern Arizona, Northern Colorado, and Sacramento State to play college football.</p><p>Over three seasons at Utah State, Love made 22 starts. He completed 8,507 passes for 60 touchdowns and 17 interceptions for 8,507 yards. He ran for 1,903 yards and 20 touchdowns as well. Love received the Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year award in 2018.</p><p>With the 26th overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draught, the Packers selected Love.

He almost missed completing a long pass to Christian Watson, which would have been his greatest completion of the day, but he concluded the night with a touchdown.</p><p>Love remarked, “I think we played well,” following the game. “The passing game moved very smoothly. Of course, Christian, the safety, made a great play on the one that went down the sideline. In addition, I believe that both of my series ended with a touchdown, so I was pleased with that, and moving ahead, I thought we played pretty well.</p><p>Matt LaFleur, the head coach, concurred with what he witnessed.</p><p>“There’s a lot to learn from it, and a lot of good came out of it,” LaFleur added. We were moving in and out of the huddle quickly, so I felt like it was a pretty excellent first exposure for him this season because of the calm and command he shown.</p><p>Love appears confident in himself and his coach appears confident in him as he enters his first season as the Packers’ starter.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Charlie Hurt Bio, Wikipedia, Wiki, Family, Twitter, Wife, Net Worth, Height, Salary</a></li><li><a href=#>Morgan Evans Girlfriend, Wikipedia, Wiki, Who Is, Dating, Net Worth, Age</a></li><li><a href=#>Oliver Anthony Wikipedia, Wiki, Music, Singer, Age, Instagram</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtoop%2BnsaK6jKWmr51f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
