She practically invented the thigh-high slit trend at the 2012 Oscars with her black strapless Versace dress that featured a surprise flash of leg — and, now, the actress is at it again, offering just a peek without giving it all away.
On Thursday, Jolie stepped out for a daytime stroll in New York City's Soho neighborhood, and for the occasion, she wore a black knitted maxi dress with a sultry twist that was so discreet, it almost went unnoticed. <a href=../../../../angelina-jolie-black-maxi-dress-side-cutouts-7692808.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../brett-davern-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Brett Davern Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
