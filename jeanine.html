I’m a cole slaw person always – the really sweet mayonnaise-y kind. But potatoes smothered in mayo? No thanks. Why is cabbage in mayo better than potatoes in mayo? No clue.&nbsp;But while I don’t go for “potato salad,” I do like a potato salad. Of course, what I mean is that this is a salad… with potatoes (and green beans and yellow wax beans and some other things). Instead of mayo,&nbsp;it’s dressed with everything that I think goes best with&nbsp;potatoes: olive oil, good dijon…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s national doughnut day, so obviously, I have a waffle recipe. The thing about doughnuts is that I like them best when other people make them. But homemade waffles – I like them, well, right at home, piping hot off of the waffle maker. (Or the next day out of the toaster). These are vegan, because I actually&nbsp;like how they get crispier around the edges&nbsp;without any eggs in the batter. Though this recipe calls for spelt flour, these will turn out equally well with all-purpose flour or a white/wheat mix. How to Make Waffles Never made waffles?

The photos are of course gorgeous, and the food… well it makes you want to dig in with a spoon because all of it, like this tabbouleh recipe, looks so incredibly vibrant and delicious! The book has been sitting on my desk for a little while now, among a slew of papers, books, and&nbsp;other&nbsp;messy-desk things – which is how this tabbouleh recipe…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>As I’m putting the finishing touches on our book, (T minus 3 days!) I thought now would be a good&nbsp;time to start making&nbsp;recipes from other peoples’ books… Last week, I briefly talked about Anna’s book, A Modern Way To Eat.&nbsp;While it’s been out for awhile now, it’s&nbsp;only recently&nbsp;been released in the US and I finally got my hands on a copy. What I love about it is that it’s more than just a book full of recipes (although there are over 200 of them!)… she offers&nbsp;tons of delicious ideas for how to mix&nbsp;flavors and textures together in creative&nbsp;but not-fussy ways.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Over here the skies are gloomy and it hardly feels like the start of Memorial Day weekend – but I hope it’s sunnier where you are and that you have some fun outdoor party&nbsp;plans this weekend.

I know it’s SO trendy… but I personally think it’s exciting to see really great healthy foods become insanely popular. Everyone’s drinking matcha lattes and matcha mochas these days – but now that it’s almost summer, here’s a really simple ice cream treat. This one’s really more of an idea than a “recipe.” I didn’t even bother breaking out the blender to make these milkshakes because in the spirit of our “grab and go” monthly series with Almond Breeze, I wanted to make these simple enough to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Jack here, writing for the blog today while Jeanine writes for the book… I have something to admit that I’m having a hard time with. I’m starting to prefer vegan “mac and cheese”&nbsp;to actual mac and cheese. Now, this is a hard one for me. You see, I love cheese. Almost every time we go to Whole Foods, I raid the “under $3 cheese” bin to find crazy new cheeses that I can barely pronounce. And a great grilled cheese is work of art.

It’s a smoky grill-tastic weekend complete with big flavors on small plates… celebrity chefs cooking alongside local chefs… and, of course, bottomless&nbsp;glasses of wine. One highlight for us&nbsp;was watching Hugh Acheson’s demo (we just love watching him on Top Chef!)… Surrounded by a pretty&nbsp;meaty food & wine fest, he made fava bean & leek soup and an arugula salad with mint. He charmed the audience talking&nbsp;about the importance of cooking at home, eating seasonally and using good ingredients.

It’s time to break out the margaritas, chips &&nbsp;salsa and of course – eat tacos! Although if you’ve been reading this blog long, you&nbsp;know that Jack and I don’t need a holiday as an excuse&nbsp;to eat tacos. These tacos are stuffed with grilled Sunshine Sweet Corn, poblano peppers, and crumbly cotija cheese. If your weather is nice this weekend, this recipe is a great excuse to break out your grill, if not you can grill these on a grill pan like I did.
