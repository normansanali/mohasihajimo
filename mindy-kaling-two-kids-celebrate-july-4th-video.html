Mindy captioned the post with red, white, and blue heart emojis to embrace the patriotic theme of the day.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-3></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the casual clip,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Office&nbsp;alum</a> rocked a pair of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>black leggings</a> and an oversized blue hooded sweatshirt. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother-of-two</a> opted to go barefoot as she spent time with her family at home. Mindy playfully carried a firework sparkler in her hand and ran toward her four-year-old with it, however, Katherine jetted off behind her playground. The starlet then bolted toward her son with the sparkler while he was riding his tricycle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Soon after Mindy shared the rare video with her 6.5 million followers, many of them took to the comments to react to the silly post and gush over <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her children</a>. “I love that you don’t show your kids on social media!”, one fan wrote, along with a clapping emoji, while another added, “They’re so big! Looks like you guys had fun.” Meanwhile, other fans couldn’t get over Mindy’s General Mills hoodie. “Queen Mindy in the GM drip!!!!”, one admirer joked, while another penned, “Is that a General Mills hoodie??? Asking the important questions here.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mindy-kaling-kids-4th-of-july-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The&nbsp;Never Have I Ever&nbsp;co-creator welcomed her eldest child in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dec. 2017</a>, about three years before she gave birth to Spencer in Sept. 2020. Although the identity of the children’s father has remained private for years, Mindy has explained that despite rumors,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>B.

I was never a ‘kid’ person. When my mom passed though, it just clicked in me: I wanted kids with such intense certainty,” she began in the photo’s caption. “Now I’m just trying to be present for them (hard for me! I’m impatient!), being up for anything (again hard for me, I am not whimsical!), and stay healthy for these two guys.” Mindy also noted that she is the “healthiest” she has been in “years” amid her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>weight loss journey</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49uZqahnpnGbrfApaCnn12pxLB5yqKbrGWTmrmmrtGaq55lmqq5unmTrZ9mrpmZsrB7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
