God said it’s my turn, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the little spirit that grows inside of me. I am yours, baby, and you are mine.”</p><p>Three days later, Us Weekly confirmed that the reality star’s ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>O.T. Genasis</strong> is the father of her child</a>. The former couple split in June after dating on and off for two years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“<a href=#>Malika didn’t want to make O.T. part of her pregnancy journey</a> unless he wanted to be involved,” a source told Us exclusively in October. “They are talking and feeling it out. He’s been getting more involved as her pregnancy has progressed.”</p><p>Even though <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>‘s BFF froze her eggs ahead of her pregnancy, Haqq revealed in November that <a href=#>her baby-to-be was conceived “in love.”</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Malika-Haqq-Celebrates-8-Months-of-Pregnancy-With-Nude-Baby-Bump-Photo.jpg><p>She explained to her twin sister, <strong>Khadijah Haqq </strong>in a&nbsp;Side by Side&nbsp;clip: “The reason why I was so excited to learn that I was pregnant because I knew that my life was gonna change for the better. The greatest blessing I’ve always wanted but didn’t know how I was going to get it is finally here. I didn’t know when I was gonna have children, so deciding to freeze my eggs as a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> to myself for my 35th birthday is pretty hilarious now at this point because I have eggs in the freezer that I may never use. I made a baby in love and those eggs weren’t necessary.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammZyeuKJ5x5qoqmWjna6zsdJmpa6clWKvoq7YZpmupaBivaqvjHFkpqeeqbW0ecinq6hloKeyqLrAp5qyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
