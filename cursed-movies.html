Based on Canadian author Mordecai Richler’s 1963 novel The Incomparable Atuk, the film has had a number of directors and actors attached to it, but unfortunately, tragedy has prevented the film from ever coming to fruition.</p><p>The first director to attempt Atuk was Norman Jewison. <a href=# rel=noopener>Collider</a> reports that Jewison had enlisted Tod Carroll to write the script for Atuk in the early 1970s, but ultimately moved on from the project to direct Jesus Christ Superstar.</p><p>It wasn’t until a decade later, in 1982, that <a href=# rel=noopener>John Belushi</a> got hold of the script and signed on to play the lead. Unfortunately, on March 5, 1982, Belushi died from a drug overdose at the age of 33.</p><p>Six years later, in 1988, the film finally found its next star in Sam Kinison. In this instance, production on the film actually began, and Kinison managed to shoot a few scenes of Atuk. But as Carroll later told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles Times</a>, Kinison wanted parts of the script to be rewritten, ultimately leading the project to once again be abandoned.</p><p>And then on April 10, 1992, Kinison died in a car accident. He was 38.</p><p>Shortly after, <a href=# rel=noopener>John Candy</a> expressed interest in Atuk — then died after a heart attack at the age of 43 on March 4, 1994.</p><p>Soon enough, comedy legend Chris Farley was in talks to finally bring Atuk to the big screen. Like the others before him, though, <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Farley</a> faced an untimely death, overdosing in December 1997.</p><p>To this day, it seems that Atuk was simply never meant to be, and some believe it’s a cursed film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonykwdGsnJ1lnaTDqrHSaGs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
