That was the mistake,” he said, as relayed by MMA Junkie. “I like the kid. Listen, do I think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Burgos</a> was gonna move on and be a world champion and all this? No. But he’s fun. I like guys that come out, and they bring it every single time they fight and guys who want to perform and guys who want to win.</p><p class=p1>“Who has it more than that kid does? So I’m happy for him. I’m happy for him, and good for the PFL too. He’s a great kid and not just an exciting, fun fighter, but he’s a great person. So, yeah, good for everybody involved in that. We’re not perfect, but we don’t f*ck up often.
