OK, so we don’t know him personally, but we’re allowed to take a guess — right? Responsible for making Guardians of the Galaxy one of Marvel’s most iconic franchises, everything the guy touches seems to turn to gold. He’s funky, he’s fresh, he’s shaking up the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DCU</a>. After being hired to co-head DC Studios, Gunn and co. have decided to make some serious changes for the future.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Whether it’s Superman, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, or the Teen Titans — James Gunn has canceled them all. First it was the rumored Man of Steel 2 that Henry Cavill had been re-attached to, then Wonder Woman 3, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batgirl</a> was in post-production when the plug was pulled, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Titans</a> has finally been given the boot too.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>Out of them all though, fans seem to be the most upset about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Doom Patrol</a>. Running for four seasons, this inventive series has also been axed from the DC lineup. One wayward fan took to Twitter, calling out Gunn and his recent decision only to find the director eager to explain himself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>That’s not how TV works.</p>— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=#>January 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>One sentence was all he needed to shut us the heck up about all this. Yes, it sucks that DC is headed in a new direction, but when it comes to creative decisions — you can’t pick and choose. If they’re going to reinvent themselves, they have to start from scratch. Sure, Doom Patrol was great, but to make room for the future things had to change.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>No one really knows what’s in store for DC Studios, and until the release dates and press conferences are held — your guess is as good as ours. We just hope that James Gunn knows what he’s doing, and by the looks of it, he does.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqllah6qMHNp2SwoaSderW0xGanmqyZmruksYyonWaZXaiuqrrTZpyxqJyWtq%2B%2FjLCfsmWYmnqku9Slm6esXajBsLyMnaaopV2lrrW%2BzqVkn6qfonqmusOipaBn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
