Edinson was born as the last child of a family of only 3 male children.</p><p>Growing up, he found love in football thanks to being encouraged by his hard-working parents who made sure that Cavani <span>“always had food and clothing,”. <span>He</span></span>&nbsp;thrived in the urban surroundings and congestion of Salto.</p><p>The fruits of the tight street pitches that Cavani played in as a child were later seen in his brilliant technique and mental strength. Basically, Cavani constantly played against older peers, who would most times roughed him up.</p><p>&nbsp;Cavani did so at the age of 9 in 1996, bringing an end to unofficial matches with the <span>‘old cargoes’</span>&nbsp; as he calls them in his area.</p><p>Right from his early years, Cavani looked to be on the path to stardom. Though once he moved to Danubio, he took a while to adjust.

Luis takes huge credit for his boy’s rise.</p><p>However, paternal pride never seemed more aching than when he talks about both Edinson’s gift and his generosity.</p><p>According to Luis, <span>“Me and Edinson used to go fishing in a beautiful lake 30km from our home. We’d take the old truck where I used to work and fish from the side. There were very big flash boats there, which is owned by the super-rich.</span></p><p><span>I remember Edinson was said …’ dad, the day I triumph at football, I’m going to get you a truck and big boat like theirs.</span></p><p><span>He was 11 at the time, he had these big dreams, and I would just laugh. But today, I have the biggest truck and boat in Uruguay,” </span>he says, pointing at them.</p><p>“It’s hard to express with words the pride you feel when you see your son triumph in life, when you see him open up new paths, you see him loved by people, and you see he hasn’t changed his way of being, that he remains the same humble child who maintains a low profile and lives his life simply.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=about-edinson-cavanis-mother></span>About Edinson Cavani’s Mother:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Berta Gómez is the name of Edinson Cavani’s mother. The Uruguay striker’s mother has once explained how his son’s hunger cost her to give up all activities just to provide him with much motherly care throughout his career path.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=edinson-cavanis-brother></span>Edinson Cavani’s Brother:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>His elder brother is Walter Guglielmone.

He is also a striker and just a year older than him.</p><p>The Edinson Cavani Family Life is indeed centred around football men and a supporting mother of the home. Quite similar to that of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=edinson-cavani-love-life-with-maria-soledad-cabris-yarrus></span>Edinson Cavani Love Life with Maria Soledad Cabris Yarrús:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Edinson Cavani’s love story is full of Ups and Downs and quite similar to Anthony Martial’s&nbsp;and much opposite to that of Marcus Rashford,&nbsp;Roberto Firmino, and&nbsp;Gabriel Jesus. The full story is discussed in this article.</p><p>Cavani has always been in love with his childhood sweetheart named, Maria Soledad Cabris Yarrús.</p><p>They both got married and were blessed with two sons.

Lucas, unlike Bautista, is very fond of his dad.</p><p>Edinson Cavani, however has a strong relationship with his sons. He loves to take his boys to every victory celebration.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=edinson-cavani-relationship-issues></span>Edinson Cavani Relationship Issues:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A piece of shocking news came in 2014 when Cavani announced that he and his wife were to get a divorce, following an initial split between the two the year before. Their marriage only lasted for two years.</p><p>This was a time Cavani’s personal life went thru a rough patch. A time he really suffered from a lack of confidence on the pitch.</p><p>They separated after it was revealed he was allegedly having an affair with a 22-year-old Italian woman, later identified as María Rosaria Ventrone (pictured below), from Caserta not far from <span>Napoli,</span>&nbsp;where Cavani played at the time.</p><p>It was this picture that led to the split up and divorce.</p><p>His ex-wife (Maria) said the following about him before the divorce.</p><p><span><span>“I do not trust this man. Do you want to trust a husband who leaves his wife just a few days after the birth of their child?…</span></span></p><p><span><span>When our son Lucas was born, I learned that he was with another girl. It was a shock when I saw the nasty pic. He explained the benefits of me giving birth in Uruguay to be quieter than in Naples where we would be besieged (by the press).</span></span></p><p><span><span>He wanted to leave me there to feel freer and enjoy the fact that I would be busy building our new life. When I returned, I tried in every way to save our marriage.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I did not want to remove my children from their father, I thought we could recover. It was hopeless. Edinson became a different person and unrecognizable.”</span></span></p><p>Maria ended up winning their divorce battle in court. The court, in the end, ordered Cavani to pay her €25,000 monthly, which is meant for herself and the kids.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=edinson-cavani-%e2%80%93-moving-on-after-divorce></span>Edinson Cavani – Moving on after Divorce:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After&nbsp;<span>the divorce</span> was finalized by mid of 2013, the whole attention was on Ventrone, the lady behind their marital dissolution.</p><p>At some point, it was even rumoured that Cavani was ready to formalize his relationship with his former mistress. Things didn’t go that way, though. No such thing happened, and things ended between them.</p><p>Edinson Cavani moved on and entered a fresh relationship with beautiful Jocelyn Burgardt.</p><p>Jocelyn Burgardt is a stunning, curvy model and&nbsp;<span>Samba</span>&nbsp;dancer from Uruguay. She has a &nbsp;degree in Cultural Management.</p><p>She is a media sensation in both Italy to Uruguay. Sadly there isn’t much information about this magnificent creature, born and raised in Bella Union, Artiga, Uruguay.</p><p>We are still digging. He takes her everywhere, including the pitch of play to celebrate wonderful moments with his club, fans, and teammates.</p><p>The Edinson Cavani Love Story is always a focus of interest for media unlike that of Danny Drink Water and Ousmane Dembele whose relationship life is still widely unknown as at the time of writing.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=edinson-cavani-personal-life></span>Edinson Cavani Personal Life:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>First thing first, he has this very humble personality.

His hunting spree of wild boars and bush pigs did in the dead hours of night amid the hillside woods of north Uruguay.</p><p>Below is Mr Luis Cavani handling a.243 calibre rifle which he had just used for his nocturnal hunting session with his son, killing two boars, six hares, and, apparently, some protected creature we are not allowed to reveal in this blog.</p><p>According to his father,</p><p><span>“We always did it when Edinson was a kid, and we still do. We both love to spend time fishing and hunting.</span></p><p><span>Afterwards, we get only three hours of sleep at night. Edi’s never going to stop hunting in the woods!</span></p><p><span>As for fishing, he always says it calms him. This has always been a way of life for us, We love to pack our latest kills packed on sticks.

He has been associated with Catholicism throughout his whole life. His Christian faith is proved below.</p><p>In the pic below, Edi was videoed praying&nbsp;with a member of the coaching staff. This was at the end of the 2011 Copa America football tournament final against Paraguay held at the Monumental stadium in Buenos Aires on July 24, 2011.</p><p>His faith saw him through, and Uruguay won their match.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=edinson-cavani-idol></span>Edinson Cavani Idol:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>First, he has the looks of Gabriel Batistuta, who he says is his football idol.

Indeed, he has tried and succeeded in possessing every aspect of Batistuta’s look and style.</p><p>Cavani’s love of Batistuta made him follow the Italian league that <span>Gabriel Batistuta</span> played for in his first spell in Europe.</p><p>More so, it is based on the fact that as a kid, Cavani’s grandparents were said to have emigrated to Marinello, which is a few kilometres from Florence, where Batistuta’s Fiorentina is located.</p><p>His grandparents would most times go watch the legend play at Florentina. This is what instigated Cavani’s dream of following in Batistuta’s footsteps. Both have the same goal celebration, as displayed below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=edinson-cavani-nickname></span>Edinson Cavani Nickname:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The player is referred to as <span>“El Matador”.&nbsp;<span>The nickname denotes that of a lead striker who is always capable of taking the bull&nbsp;</span></span>by the horns every time he steps out on the playing field!</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=edinson-cavani-cars></span>Edinson Cavani Cars:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Edinson loves beautiful low cars.
