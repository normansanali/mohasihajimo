At the same time, the 36-year-old shared that the gradual development of Creed and Anderson’s estranged relationship stemmed from&nbsp;Fullmetal Alchemist&nbsp;and&nbsp;My Hero Academia.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Aside from those references,&nbsp;Creed III&nbsp;also featured a flashback, which displays Creed’s childhood and his love for anime as posters and other memorabilia are showcased throughout his room. The items featured in the room included a&nbsp;Robotech and&nbsp;Lupin the Third&nbsp;poster, a&nbsp;Naruto&nbsp;banner, and a Gunpla figurine from&nbsp;Gundam Build Fighter.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=839 data-injectable=true>Further in the discussion, Jordan, who also directed the project, opened up about what it was like using his own experience from his own childhood to help make the story come to life. Jordan explained that although he had a lot of “fun,” he felt it was essential to take those moments from his life because it helped make Creed more “real and relatable” due to the similar life experiences that he and the character have gone through.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p id=K52qIU>“It was fun. [laughs] You know, as an actor, you find ways to bring a piece of yourself and your reality to these characters and make them real and relatable as much as you can. At a certain point, Adonis was going through the same things I was going through, those same types of challenges.</p><p id=K52qIU>Exploring the idea of identity. Your blessings, your gifts, your survivor’s guilt, your impostor syndrome. The relationship between you and your loved ones, your family, your friends; with communicating and talking through your emotions. How do you deal with success? How do you deal with being in the spotlight and still retaining some type of normal life while staying grounded? All of those things, man.&nbsp;“</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>Later, Jordan added that stepping into the directorial role allowed him to inject a bit of himself into the character of Creed. In doing so, he was ecstatic at the opportunity to plant as many anime Easter eggs and references as he could.</p><p id=LLH1le>“When the opportunity presented itself to craft this character who I am, in a sense, becoming, in a way that felt true to my own reality, it was a great feeling, man. Put those Easter eggs in there, put those anime references in there — let them see and feel who this kid was, and who he is now. This is where he came from; this is how it started. I had a chance to almost redo the origin story, essentially. That was a very satisfying and gratifying experience.”</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false>To catch all the anime references in the film, check out Creed III, now playing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXam1pnnCq5yenF1oeqK6yKacZqqVm7Kzsc2cnKxlkaOxbrHArKueql2atKi%2FjKKlZpmUpLuqv4yrpqilXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
