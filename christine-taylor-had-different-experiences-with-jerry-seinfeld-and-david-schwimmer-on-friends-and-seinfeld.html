Both shows had various guest stars along the way, as some actors and actresses got the pleasure of working on both shows. That was the case for Christine Taylor, who got the rare experience of playing the love interests of both Jerry and Ross on their respective shows.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a closer look at Taylor's time on both sitcoms. She recalled her experiences alongside Today, and they proved to be quite different.

Taylor admitted that the role was career-altering, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was especially surprised by her interaction with Jerry behind the scenes</a>.</p><p>Although the actor at times gets questioned for his behavior behind the scenes, that was not the case with his time alongside Christine Taylor. Taylor revealed that she was always treated like an equal by Jerry, and that he especially took an interest in her upbringing.</p><p>“The scenes that I had with Jerry, where he just was really the most normal — for being Jerry Seinfeld. I had done a little work here and there at that point, but it was like I was just his equal."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continues, "And he was so curious just about my life. And, you know, I grew up Catholic. And so of course, he was fascinated with details about that. And going to Catholic school and wearing uniforms. And just like, coming from Allentown, Pennsylvania, where I came from. But we just had these fun conversations. And he was so easy to talk to and just a good guy. I think they were all just such a really welcoming group of actors.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld Had A Secret Huddle With His Main Seinfeld Co-Stars Prior To The Finale, Leaving Everyone Teary-Eyed</a></span></p><p>It was a positive experience for Taylor looking back, and she would appear on another major sitcom as well - though her experience on Friends proved to be quite different.</p><h2 id=christine-taylor-had-to-39-swallow-her-pride-39-during-her-role-on-friends>Christine Taylor Had To 'Swallow Her Pride' During Her Role On Friends</h2><p>Speaking alongside Today, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor detailed her time on Friends</a> and it proved to be very different and a little more stressful given her role.

So it was like, ‘Couldn't I have gotten one where I was clothed and with hair?"</p><p>Taylor had praise for the main cast of women on the show for praising her bald look.</p><p>“To their credit, Jennifer, Courteney, Lisa, they're like, ‘You look so beautiful bald,’” she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was like, ‘I look like an alien.’ And I had a lot of hair then too, so it was packing all of my hair into the bald cap, which sort of made my head grow even bigger.

As far as Friends was concerned, Taylor was given the role and didn't have any type of audition. She jumped on the part instantly. “I didn't even have to audition,” Taylor said. “I had already done ‘The Brady Bunch’ and had a little work under my belt. I got the call saying, ‘Hey, do you wanna do an arc on "Friends"? I said, ‘Absolutely, hands down.’ I don't even need to read it. Just yes, yes, yes, of course."</p><p>As for her time on Seinfeld, Taylor recalls her audition being extremely stressful and in front of some major stars in the business.</p><p>She tells Today, “Knowing you were going to go in and read with Jerry and the writers was so nerve-wracking,” she said. “You go into this office, which is right sort of near the soundstage that they shot on. But as an actress, you just kind of get a parking pass that's like a mile away. And then you walk all the way. And you're dressed up and you want to do a good job. I remember taking the walk, that sort of scary walk of going over your lines.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, Taylor revealed that everyone was great in the audition room, and that it all went extremely well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGqusRmq5qxnKS%2FbrTAnWSdoZabsrOxza1knrCgmr%2Bqsc2cnKxlp57BqXnJnqmrsV2osqq6xZ6jnWWRo7FusMCvoJ1lo5i1uLXMppyrZZ%2Bjeqe%2ByJ6lnatdlruledKeoKeelaGxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
