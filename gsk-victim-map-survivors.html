Now that his survivors can finally feel safe from their tormenter, many are breaking their silence.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In some cases, GSK rape victims lived so close by they were basically neighbors, but due to the fear and shame they felt about their experience, they only recently learned just how close they were.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Golden State Killer's victim map shows he kept returning to the same neighborhoods.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Though he was known only as the East Area Rapist in the late 70s, DeAngelo had several favorite neighborhoods he would return to over and over, sometimes hitting houses that were literally around the corner from a previous victim.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the town of Rancho Cordova, he hit at least six homes. His first and third victims were not just around the corner from each other but shared a common drainage ditch in the alley according to citizen sleuth Melanie Barbeau, who took true crime writer Michelle McNamara on a tour of the EAR's early attacks.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Though GSK's victims' names are well-known, many survivors are not.</h2><p>The last known East Area attack was in July of 1979. After more than 50 rapes and attempted attacks, including his first-known murders, DeAngelo moved south. While some of the rape survivors in the Sacramento area have spoken out publicly about their experience, others have either passed away or remained anonymous. However, many of them or their surviving family members will have the opportunity to break their silence when DeAngelo is sentenced at a hearing scheduled for August 17, 2020.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>For example, rape victim No. 5, Jane Carson-Sandler, who now lives in South Carolina, spoke with Hilton Head's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Island Packet</a> newspaper about her experience. And one of GSK's youngest victims, Kris Pedretti, spoke about her harrowing experience in great detail for the documentary I'll Be Gone in the Dark. In fact, the title for the book and documentary comes from the threat DeAngelo whispered in her ear as he held a knife to her neck: "If you scream or move i will put this knife through your throat, and i'll be gone in the dark."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another of DeAngelo's teenage survivors is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Berwert</a>, who had just turned 13 when she was attacked in her home in Contra Costa County. Mary was one of the last rape victims in the East Bay area.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Golden State Killer's list of murder victims includes at least 13.</h2><p>Though the majority of DeAngelo's murders took place after he apparently moved south, he did admit in his June 29 hearing to all 13 murders attributed to him, including the 1975 murder of Claude Snelling in Visalia, Calif., and the 1978 murders of Katie and Brian Maggiore in Rancho Cordova.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>EAST AREA RAPIST CASE:<br>A happy and in love.
