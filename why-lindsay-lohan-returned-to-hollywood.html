These problems were also effecting her career. Stories of unprofessional behavior caused her to lose her reputation in Hollywood. For a long time, it seemed like Lohan's acting career was finished.</p><p>However, Lohan is set to star in a new movie for Netflix this year titled Falling for Christmas, out November 10. Netflix also announced a creative partnership with Lohan for two films. Here is the story of how <a href=#>Lohan</a> reignited her acting career after so many counted her out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-grew-to-stardom-as-a-child-star>Lindsay Lohan Grew To Stardom As A Child Star</h2><p>Lindsay Lohan was raised on Long Island, NY and started her career as a child. She signed with Ford Models at the age of three, modeling for Calvin Klein Kids and Abercrombie. She also appeared in several television commercials from Wendy's to Pizza Hut.

She signed to Casablanca Records with Tommy Mottola leading the way. The single "Rumors" became Lohan's first official single and music video. Her sophomore album, "A Little More Personal (Raw)," was released a year later.</p><p>The album's single, "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)," was a look at the dark side of her private life that was starting to become very public. In this case, her strained relationship with her father Michael, who was divorced from Lohan's mother Dina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the next several years, many incidents made headlines surrounding Lohan's partying and unprofessional behavior.

He said there were several times Lohan was late to set and many times she didn't show up at all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan Is Officially A Married Woman!</a></span></p><p>In 2007, Lohan was arrested for the first time for driving under the influence. This set in motion a series of arrests, court dates, and jail sentences. There were also many trips to rehab and many failed attempts at an acting comeback.
