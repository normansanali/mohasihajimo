But what went wrong between the New Girl actress, 31, and<strong> Death Cab for Cutie</strong> frontman, 32, who married just over two years ago?</p><p>A source told <strong>Us</strong> the split "was mutual and amicable," adding, "There was no third party involved."</p><p>Gibbard recently told New York Magazine about his love at first site with the <strong>She & Him </strong>singer. "'I'd seen her in movies and obviously I thought she was very beautiful," he said. "I was just awestruck that she was even talking to me."</p><p>In July, Deschanel told <a href=#>iVillage</a> that her time apart from her hubby brought them closer. "I'm a pretty busy person, so it allows us to get our work done," she told the site. "And when we see each other again, we have a lot of stuff to talk about."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Probably the most surprising thing [about married life] is that it's not really that different," she told <a href=#>iVillage</a>. "You still have to make a commitment and think about that commitment every day. It’s not like you get married and then all the work is done for you. You get married and you’re still in a relationship and you’re still doing your best to make it the best relationship you can."</p><p>Deschanel added that she put work into her marriage, "but it's not work in a bad way."</p><p>"It's just that you can't expect to make no effort," she told iVillage. "You still have to make the effort and be kind and understanding. It sort of just solidifies your commitment."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGazp5%2Baxm6wxKyaoZmemrlursSnZKChkpeus7CMsJ%2BarF2ssq%2FAjLCpqKaXYn9xfZBraGpn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
