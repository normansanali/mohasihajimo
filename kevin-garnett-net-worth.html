For 2014, Kevin’s annual salary is about 28 million dollars for the one season. He is an NBA player with the Brooklyn Nets, and this is the main source of Garnett’s net worth today. Also in only 2014, Garnett earned 4 million dollars because of a deal with the brand Anta sportswear and the mineral water Zinco. And for the deal with Brooklyn Nets Garnett received another huge sum of money – more than 12 million dollars.</p><h3>Kevin Garnett Net Worth $180 Million</h3><p>Kevin Maurice Garnett was born on May 19 1976, in Greenville, South Carolina. He is the second child of O’Lewis McCullough and Shirley Garnett. However, Kevin took his mothers family name, as Shirley Garnett was never married to McCullough and they actually separated after a short period of time. So Kevin with his brothers was raised by his mother only, at least until the age of 12, as later a stepfather appeared in Garnett’s life.</p><p>Talking about Garnett’s career in sports, which helped him to increase his net worth so much, he became interested in sports at an early age. He started to play basketball during his high school years, when he played with his team from Mauldin High School.</p><p>If we would like to better understand how rich is Kevin Garnett, we should pay more attention to all the earnings he made, as these are really huge sums of money. The serious career of K. Garnett as a baskatball player which made a start to Kevin’s net worth started in 1999, when during the 1999-2000 season K. Garnett received almost $17 million for awesome playing. Then in 2000, he won a gold medal in the Olympic Games. But this was only beginning of a great caareer – only three years later, in 2003, when he played with the Minnesota Timberwolves during 2003-2004 season, Garnett’s net worth increased greatly, and furthermore, he became extremely popular in the United States and also in the rest of the world.</p><p>However, everything was not so successful with his team, and in the next season Kevin was traded to the Boston Celtics. The price of Kevin was amazingly high – the Timberwolves received five famous athletes in exchange – Theo Ratliff, Al Jefferson, Gerald Green, Ryan Games and Sebastian Telfair.</p><p>But the highest price he was paid was while playing for the Boston Celtics – in 2010 for the that season Kevin was paid 18,800,000 million dollars. His earnings in the past several years are also quite big – only for playing in 2012-2013 season he received about $12 million.</p><p>So there should be no doubt about how much money Garnett has nowadays.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.578680203046><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kevin Garnett</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$180 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>8&nbsp;million USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 19, 1976</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Greenville, South Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>254 lbs (115 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player, Athlete, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Farragut Career Academy, Mauldin High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Brandi Padilla (m. 2004)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Capri Garnett</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>O'Lewis McCullough, Shirley Garnett</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Louis McCullough, Sonya Garnett, Ashley Garnett</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Kevin Maurice Garnett , K.G.</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/kevingarnett</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0307812</a></td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Awards</td><td>NBA Most Valuable Player Award, All-NBA Team, NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, NBA All-Defensive Team, NBA All-Rookie Team, National Basketball Association Awards - J.
