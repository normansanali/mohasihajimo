Nevertheless, if you're feeling they're too strong, consider modifying that they get less charges restored per day, or increase the % to break the wand when expended (e.g. 20% instead of 5%). Your combats may have varied, but these are really limited use items.<p>(1) Diminishing returns. If you get one of these wands at 5th level, pretty awesome. At 8-10, less so. 11+, you've got a ton of better options to use an Action on.<br>(2) Requires enemies to be lined up in a certain way to maximize effect. Other spells may be more optimal at the time.<br>(3) Requires an Action. Refer to #1. Mass damage is still ok, but not what it was in AD&D.<br>(4) Requires Attunement. At low levels, sure, odds are you're not full on attunement items. But a Wand will be hard to justify at some point.</p><p>In any case, I ran Out of the Abyss and saw the finale demon lord killed by a Wand of Magic Missiles. Not the +2 weapon, not a 7th level spell, not an act of Divine Intervention. A measly wand. But, someone in the group held on knowing Demons were resistant to a lot of things, but not force magic. There was something satisfying to the player about using a Magic Item to finish off the boss.</p><p>Unless you're rolling randomly, you control what comes into your game. So whether it's overpowered or not is irrelevant in that scenario. If you're random, you could run into a Vorpal Weapon or the like early on as well. So I don't do much about it. We did random loot once. If the party rolled something crazy useful, so be it (odds are, though, they roll junk). If they get lucky, I want them to savor it. So consider not diminishing the Wands.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prrWqKmlnF6kv6h706GpnpmUqHy1tM6unqGso2K8r3nWmqWdq12Xsqq6xmamr52ipby4sdGem2ahnmKCpnqVbG1qb2Bk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
