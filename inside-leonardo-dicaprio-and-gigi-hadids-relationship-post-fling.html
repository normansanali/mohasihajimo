(Hadid and Malik, 30, <a href=#>split in 2021</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Inside-Leonardo-DiCaprio-and-Gigi-Hadids-%E2%80%98Amicable-Relationship-Post-Fling-%E2%80%98They-Are-Still-in-Touch-Promo-2.jpg><p>During <a href=#>Hadid and DiCaprio’s on-off romance</a>, distance and conflicting work schedules became a deterrent for the model. “They both travel a lot by nature of their jobs. But Gigi is taking more work that <a href=#>allows her to spend more time with her child</a>,” the insider says. “And Leo still travels a lot and likes to go out a lot. And there’s temptation and all those factors had been concerns of hers.”</p><p>Despite their connection, Hadid put the brakes on their romantic relationship in part because “she doesn’t want her boyfriend to be in and out going to clubs and events and working all the time,” the source notes. “She wants someone to be hands-on and a partner.”</p><p>Furthermore, Hadid “doesn’t want to date someone seriously unless she can introduce them to her child,” the insider adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Inside-Leonardo-DiCaprio-and-Gigi-Hadids-%E2%80%98Amicable-Relationship-Post-Fling-%E2%80%98They-Are-Still-in-Touch-Promo-3.jpg><p>DiCaprio and Hadid were first linked in September 2022. Us confirmed in February that <a href=#>they called it quits</a>, but they reconnected the following month after <a href=#>running into each other at the Oscars</a>.</p><p>However, in time, Hadid “ended up not wanting it to be that serious,” the source tells Us, sharing, “It was more her decision than Leo’s” to end things. The insider adds that Hadid and DiCaprio “eventually became closer in friendship rather than romantically.”</p><p>That connection has remained between the pair and <a href=#>Hadid “still loves” the Oscar winner</a> “as a friend and person,” the source notes. “They’ve gone their separate ways but are friends and have a lot of friends in common. It’s amicable.”</p><p>DiCaprio seemingly moved on with Hadid’s pal <a href=#><strong>Vittoria Ceretti</strong></a> in August when they were spotted getting ice cream and coffee during a stroll in Santa Barbara.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later that month, the twosome were <a href=#>seen looking cozy at an Ibiza nightclub</a>. In photos obtained by the Daily Mail, DiCaprio kissed Ceretti — who has been married to <strong>Matteo Milleri</strong> since 2020 – while dancing and laughing against a wall in the club.</p><p>Hadid has also sparked romance speculation after she and music producer <strong>Cole Bennett</strong> were seen together twice in late August. “They’ve been friends for a few years. They’ve been playing coy about their status, but they mesh really well together,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told Us in early September</a>, noting that the pair are “moving in a romantic direction.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ5y56mp5mimbxusMicmKmqmaR6orrDZp6in5litaKwyJ2qZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGK9sL%2FTZp2loZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
