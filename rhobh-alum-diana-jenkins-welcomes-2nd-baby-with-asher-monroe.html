Welcome to the world beautiful Elodie! Can’t wait to meet you! Sending lots of love to everyone! 💕💕💕.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> also chimed in, writing that she “can’t wait to meet” the couple’s little “angel.”</p><p>Jenkins <a href=#>confirmed her pregnancy</a> in December 2022, one month before announcing that she was<a href=#> exiting RHOBH</a> after only one season.</p><p>“Hi everybody … As so many of you know, Asher and I are expecting our second child later this year,” she wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in January. “You also know that due to many factors, this pregnancy is considered high risk and I am on doctor-advised bed rest. To that end, I am not able to devote myself fully to filming the next season of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. I would like to thank Bravo and Evolution for allowing me to focus on my pregnancy, and for their support and understanding. I promise to continue sharing my fertility journey with you.”</p><p>During a June 2022 episode of RHOBH, Jenkins revealed&nbsp;that she <a href=#>suffered a miscarriage</a> six months after welcoming daughter Eliyanah in 2020.</p><p>Jenkins and Monroe — who are engaged — met in March 2010 at a <a href=#>Victoria’s Secret fashion show</a>. Although the two didn’t begin dating until a couple years later, they cofounded the independent record label D Empire Entertainment in 2012.</p><p>Nearly eight years later, the lovebirds welcomed their first child together, daughter Eliyanah. “Thank you 2020 😊Happy New Year everyone 🎊🎈 🎉,” the entrepreneur captioned an Instagram video of Monroe and their newborn.</p><p>In 2021, Monroe&nbsp;shared some insight into his relationship with Jenkins and how she has supported his career.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Diana] has stood by my side through thick and thin,” he gushed to Pop Hearts TV at the time. “Without her, I would not be the man I am today. I have always looked up to her in the way she runs her life. Being a role model, war survivor, philanthropist, mother, entrepreneur and so much more. It’s hard to scratch the surface on the impact she has had on me forever.”</p><p>Prior to her relationship with Monroe, Diana was married to <strong>Roger Jenkins</strong> from 1999 to 2011. The twosome share son Innis, 22, and daughter Eneya, 19. Although the former couple split in 2011, they have remained on amicable terms.</p><p>“Will she take half my money? Of course. Without her, I would not have anything like the success I’ve had,” the banker previously told the Daily Mail about their divorce. “I love Diana and have such admiration for her as a mother, businesswoman and someone who was brilliant as a wife. We have moved on and are extremely happy with the arrangements we have in our lives. Diana will always be a very happy part of my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaroJ%2BXtW6ty66kZpyZlruiecmepaShnqh6uLHLnKamnaNif6%2BwjJuYm7FdrLa1tIyaqqGdomK6sLrRqJxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
