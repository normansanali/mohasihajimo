It’s giving Singin’ in the Rain, but we’ll let you know if we catch our central duo break into song and dance as Gatwa and Millie Gibson’s Ruby Sunday did in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">last year’s Christmas special</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The BBC has yet to officially confirm that Sethu is stepping into the TARDIS as the new companion for series 15. It’s also unclear what this would mean for Gibson’s future on the series. While she reportedly did film scenes for series 15 late last year, Gibson also hinted in a recent interview that she had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">completed her time on Doctor Who</a> and that she would begin auditioning for new roles in 2024.</p><p>“I think, now that the strike’s over, probably auditioning again, for parts, and seeing what’s out there,” Gibson told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fabric magazine</a>. “Every year has seen such change for me, it’s hard to think what might come next. I’d like to play a villain… If not that I think I’m really intrigued by biopic roles that you really need to research. I think that would be a great challenge. I don’t know, I think I’m just excited to see what’s to come.”</p><p>Time will tell when we’ll be saying goodbye to Ruby Sunday and welcoming a new companion to the show. What we do know is that the mystery surrounding Ruby’s origin will be the focus of series 14, which also has a few other questions to answer. What the heck is going on with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anita Dobson’s Mrs. Flood</a>? And who is in possession of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the gold tooth</a> containing the Master? With any luck, Russell T Davies won’t keep us waiting for the answers for too much longer.</p><p><a href=#>Danofgeek</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toppWserG0zq2mrGWWp7yuedKnprBlp522tbGMrJytZZeew6Z5xaKprKxdobywt4yaq2aqkZi1priMs5ygpJWneqq6jJymrKylorJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
