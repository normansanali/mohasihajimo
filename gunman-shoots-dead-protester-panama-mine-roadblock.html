If he is convicted, Mr Salas could be sentenced to house arrest rather than being sent to jail because of his age.</p><p>The protesters, who were opposed to a controversial mining contract, had blocked the Pan-American Highway in Chame, 51 miles from the capital Panama City.</p><p>Footage posted on social media showed the motorist walking from his car, demanding the protesters get out of the road.</p><p>Initially, Mr Salas removed tyres which were obstructing the road. The protesters, according to witnesses, shouted at the man: “Are you going to kill someone?”</p><p>The gunman replied: “You want to be the first?”</p><p>He opened fire, first shooting a protester holding a flag and then a second man who went to confront him, before walking off and removing tree trunks that had been blocking the road. He was then arrested.</p><p>Local media identified the victims as Abdiel Diaz, a teacher and union activist, and Ivan Mendoza.</p><p>The deaths are the first fatalities in protests that broke out on October 20 against a contract that allows Canada-based First Quantum Minerals to operate Central America’s biggest open pit copper mine for at least another 20 years.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The man was handcuffed and detained</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Bienvenido Velasco/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock</span></figure><p>The site, in the jungle to the west of the capital, is considered environmentally sensitive.</p><p>In an effort to calm tempers, congress last week passed a law that imposes a moratorium on new metal mining contracts and left it up to the Supreme Court to decide on whether to allow the contract with First Quantum Minerals.</p><p>Environmentalists have welcomed this decision by lawmakers, saying indeed it is the court that should rule on whether the contract violates the constitution.</p><p>But a powerful construction union called Suntracs, teachers unions and other organisations want the contract to be annulled through a law passed by Congress, so they are continuing their protests.</p><p>Panama-America said Mr Salas was born in Colon and had been a teacher at several universities.</p><p>Mr Salas was previously arrested in 2005 after weapons – including an AK-47 and M-16 - were found in his flat. He was later acquitted after a court accepted his plea that they were merely part of a collection.</p><p>He was employed as a spokesman for Marc Harris, a Panamanian accountant who was jailed for 17 years in 2004 after being convicted of money laundering and tax evasion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaK%2Bfp7mlec2erqxnYmV%2FdHuQamZpcF%2Bcwq%2B5wKdkrKCfpMG0ecOemJ1loKe8tbHSrZyrZaCWu6K5wGakoqaVYr%2BwrcObo6ibm2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
