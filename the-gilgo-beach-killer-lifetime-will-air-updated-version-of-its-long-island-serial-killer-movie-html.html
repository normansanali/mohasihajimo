She was last seen leaving a client’s house in the secluded community of Oak Beach on Long Island’s south shore. Months later, while searching for Shannan, police found the remains of several other people. They included Megan Waterman, 22; Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25; Melissa Barthelemy, 24; and Amber Lynn Costello, 27. Police suspected that the same person killed all four women.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_20>Shannan Gilbert’s body was eventually discovered in a marshy area not far from Oak Beach. Police believe she drowned accidentally.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_78>The cases fascinated the public and were the subject of multiple documentaries and books. But the identity of the killer remained a mystery. Then, in July 2023, police announced they’d arrested Heuermann, 59, who worked as an architect in Manhattan and lived on Long Island. They found evidence linking Heuermann to the deaths of Waterman, Barthelemy, and Costello. They believe he is also responsible for the death of Brainard-Barnes, though he has not been charged in that case.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_56>In addition to the Lifetime movie, <a href=#>Netflix’s 2020 movie Lost Girls</a> is also inspired by the then-unsolved case. Based on a true-crime book by Robert Kolker, it stars Amy Ryan as Mari Gilbert. It chronicles Mari’s efforts to find her daughter and the relationships she formed with the mothers and sisters of the other missing women.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_16>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMoKCln59ir6atwqFkpKGcobKzecuinZ6smaKybsPIpaNmmZmnera8w5qrnpxdq7Kzv8iopWanlmK2tb%2BMpaann12ewK2tzZ1krJ2inq6tecqio6WdomK6sMLInmWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
