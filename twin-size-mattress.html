The song depicts a sense of loyalty to the people we love, even in difficult times. The first set of lyrics talk about a flood that is coming, which is a metaphor for a challenging situation that is unavoidable. The singer declares that they will help the people they care about to swim through these difficulties. These lines emphasize the importance of supporting our loved ones through difficult times, even if it means getting dirty and muddy ourselves.</p><br><p>The second set of lyrics touch upon the idea of ignoring warning signs that we shouldn't have. The singer talks about a friend who they begged to stay, but this friend refused to accept help. They insinuate that there is no surprise that this person turned out a certain way, indicating that people's actions are often predictable based on past experiences. The chorus talks about wanting to contribute to chaos because the person singing doesn't want to just watch things happen and complain about them. They would rather make a difference - be it positive or negative.</p><br><p>The third set of lines speak about the consequences of our actions and things we say. The singer recognizes that there are lessons to be learned from every mistake and that our words and actions are not without consequences. The final lines talk about the hope of being cursed to sleep on a twin-sized mattress in someone's basement forever. This could be interpreted as the idea that we all have to start somewhere, and perhaps this is a sign of humility in recognizing where you came from.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>This is for the lions living in the wiry broke down frames of my friends bodies</u><br>I'm dedicating this song to the courageous friends who keep fighting even when their bodies are frail and weak.</p><br><p><u>When the flood water comes, it ain't gonna be clear</u><br>Life is tough, and when the hard times hit, things might get murky and unclear.</p><br><p><u>It’s gonna look like mud</u><br>The struggles we face might make everything seem dirty and hopeless.</p><br><p><u>But I will help you swim</u><br>But I will always be there to support and help my friends, especially when things get tough.</p><br><p><u>I will help you swim</u><br>I will be a source of strength and support - my friends can count on me!</p><br><p><u>I'm gonna help you swim</u><br>I will always be there, even when things feel impossible.</p><br><p><u>This is for the snakes and the people they bite</u><br>This song is also for the people who hurt others purposely or inadvertently.</p><br><p><u>For the friends I’ve made;
