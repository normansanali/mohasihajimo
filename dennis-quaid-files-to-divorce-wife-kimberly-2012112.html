"Kimberly. . . wants out of the marriage," a source close to the couple told TMZ at the time. "He's not a good husband." Buffington-Quaid filed for legal separation in October 2012, requesting joint legal and sole physical custody of their twins.</p><p>(The siblings almost died as newborns in 2007 when the medical staff at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center accidentally gave them an overdose of the drug Heparin. After filing a lawsuit with the hospital and the drug manufacturer, the couple was awarded $750,000.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>TMZ reports that Quaid was forced to wait until late November to respond with his divorce petition because the couple just moved to California over the summer, and the state requires a six-month residency before divorce papers can be filed.</p><p>Buffington-Quaid is the Vegas actor's third wife. He was wed to Sleepless in Seattle star <strong>Meg Ryan</strong>; they divorced in 2001 and are parents to Hunger Games star<strong> Jack</strong>, 20. Quaid was first married to Halloween actress <strong>PJ Soles</strong>; they divorced in 1983.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZ6jtrR50K6Yopxdm7atsdJmq6hllJ7DsL7CnmSwoZaaeqy1zJucq6SpYn9xfZFqaGtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
