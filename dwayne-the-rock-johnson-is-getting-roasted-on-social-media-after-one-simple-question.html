On one hand, he’s pretty iconic since he’s starred in a variety of films and received his own&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast & Furious</a>&nbsp;spin-off. But on the other hand, some moviegoers may have some gripes with the actor and will be willing to share them when asked.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>One opportunity for moviegoers and Rock fans to share their disappointment was through this one Twitter user, who simply asked why Johnson has “fallen out of favor” over the past few years. People were ready to share their argument as to why Johnson, despite him still being a recognized actor, isn’t as great compared to other actors who started in wrestling, such as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Bautista</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Cena</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why has The Rock fallen out of favor with a lot of people over the past few years? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EZBLpx7wXF</a></p>— The Moonlight Warrior 🌙 (@BlackMajikMan90) <a href=#>May 20, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=true>One common argument that fans pointed out was that Johnson seems to play the same character in every movie that he’s in. One fan even went as far as to share four images of the actor in different movies. And, we’re not going to lie, these screengrabs look very similar. You could somewhat tell what films they’re from; but for the untrained eye, it could be assumed they’re different scenes in one film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Because he’s the same character in every movie… and he comes back to WWE and he doesn’t really add much <a href=#>https://t.co/BjhujksdUT</a></p>— 🍊Elgin Barrett Eugene Smith lll🍊 (@Southside_Gunn) <a href=#>May 22, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>These are 4 different films <a href=#>https://t.co/VetrTNlzp9</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0SrmlAezLf</a></p>— 𝒦𝒾𝓃𝑔 ℛ𝑜𝒷𝒷 (@bigboibobbyboi) <a href=#>May 22, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, others argued about the actor’s ego is what has caused him to fall out of vogue. This could be supported by how Johnson supposedly has a clause in his contracts that state he can’t lose in fights. At the same time, it was argued that Johnson isn’t really an actor but more of a brand, hence why he doesn’t want to look bad in films, which kind of makes sense since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney used him to announce the upcoming Moana live-action adaptation</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Because he’s not an actor, he’s a brand.

We have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bautista who opened up his departure from the MCU</a>&nbsp;in hopes to do more serious roles. Meanwhile, Cena has appeared in different movie genres and is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">willing to be a mermaid in the upcoming Barbie movie</a>.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Compare that to Johnson’s movie credits, which mostly contain a variety of action-adventure films. The only thing unique he’s done was do voice-over work for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a>‘s music video for ‘The Man.’</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=false>Perhaps Johnson needs to take a page out of his wrestling colleagues’ playbook and consider experimenting with other genres for once. Play the bad guy rather than an anti-hero. And showcase your talents as an actor by stepping away from your comfort zone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxuK3Yp5xmrJiaerO7wqRko6eYo8CwuoyiqmaflanBqrrGZqmomaOpsqV5zqdkrKeTnq6tecyem6KZXZaztbHRZqannV2otq68y55kqq2VqMGqu81o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
