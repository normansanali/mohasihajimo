Arden Teacher Arrested<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Glen Alejandrino is a 49-year-old teacher from Arden Middle School who has been arrested for the sexual abuse allegation. The sheriff’s office stated in a release on Wednesday that “there are several victims of the teacher covering the period of 2019 to 2021.”</p><p>They further noted, “In response to Alejandrino’s arrest, the&nbsp;Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office&nbsp;issued a statement today. We can confirm that the instructor was away on leave for the entirety of the 2021–22 academic year, albeit we cannot share any further information regarding this current inquiry. In this situation, we are completely collaborating with law enforcement.”</p><p>[image-]</p><p>Alejandrino is accused of several crimes, including providing illegal materials to a minor under the age of 14, engaging in improper behavior with a child under the age of 14, communicating with a minor with the intent to involve in sexual activity, contributing to the delinquency of a little, and molestation of an under 18 child.</p><h2 id=glenn-alejandrino-family><span class=ez-toc-section id=glenn-alejandrino-family></span> Glenn Alejandrino Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is not much information available on Glen Alejandrino’s family. However, he was living in Sacramento all alone, assuming the sexual misconduct also took place at his home.</p><p>Perhaps, Alejandrino’s family is keeping a low profile given the current situation. Hopefully, the sheriff will reveal more information about this case soon.</p><h2 id=glenn-alejandrino-facebook-photo-amp-mugshot><span class=ez-toc-section id=glenn-alejandrino-facebook-photo-mugshot></span> Glenn Alejandrino Facebook Photo & Mugshot<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no account on Facebook that matches the details of Glen Alejandrino. Maybe, the Arden Middle School teacher did not have a Facebook account.</p><p>Glen’s mugshot is not out yet. However, the young offender faces a $1,000 fine and six months to a year in jail if they consume alcohol and cause significant physical harm or death to themselves or others.</p><p>Similarly, it is illegal in California to sell illegal materials to a minor. The punishment for this crime is state jail time, unlike other illegal materials-related felonies. A sentence of three, five, or seven years in state prison results from a conviction under this law.&nbsp;</p><p>Alejandrino is accused of several offenses, such as sexual or lascivious activities with a minor under the age of 14 and sexual acts on a youngster with an age gap of more than ten years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ygo56mnmKurbHJmqWdqpmjvG6AmGaYq5yVo3q0rcKrmKadnqm8bsDEmpqhnaJirrO%2BxKyrnpxdm7yzecCbrKydXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
