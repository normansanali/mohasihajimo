However, he once dated a woman called Anais Naing.</p><p>“This is my girlfriend Anais – she’s from Brittany in France. We met on the street because we lived in the same part of London,” he said.</p><p>Back in 2018, he broke up with his model girlfriend, Anne de Paula.</p><p>O’Donoghue shared that his family loved Anais when he presented her to them.</p><p>“My mum loved her. They offered her lots of tea,” he added.</p><p>He also once told the media that he is very much in love with his new girlfriend.</p><p>“Me and my girlfriend are super in love. We love watching sunsets, and getting up early in the morning now. Just doing really, really simple things, going for a swim. That’s what really matters to me. This first lockdown was a bit of a novelty – the second was when everyone took a bit of a hit mentally. I think everybody has kind of realigned their lives to what was important and what means something to them. If you were with the wrong person, you probably aren’t with them now. Life came into sharper focus,” he shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyRo7u6ec6dpqenl53CpnnWop2eZZSksrR5w5qlp7Fdm7%2BwuYytn55lo5i%2FqrzTZp%2BarpVirm7DyJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
