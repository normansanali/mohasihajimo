The individual was found to be deceased. The deputies said that Garrett McAmis was a passenger in the vehicle that was involved in the fatal accident that occurred on U.S. Route 129. At Chilhowee Lake, divers with the Blount Special Operations and Response Team discovered him dead inside his truck, as reported by the Blount County Sheriff’s Office.</p><p>The Tennessee Highway Patrol is currently looking into the cause of the crash as part of their investigation. According to the findings of the preliminary inquiry, McAmis was driving north on Calderwood Highway at the 16 Mile Marker when the accident occurred because he followed a right bend in the road. On the other hand, they said that he crossed the middle line, collided with a guardrail, and then launched himself into the air before crashing into the lake.</p><p>“We did not anticipate this turning out this way,” the British Columbia Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) stated in a statement. “Sheriff James Lee Berrong wants the family and friends of Garrett to know that he is thinking of them during this difficult time.” The Blount County Sheriff’s Office is asking for the help of the general public in order to identify a young man who was last seen on October 13 and is now 18 years old. The individual’s last known location was in Blount County.</p><p>At approximately 11:30 p.m., Garrett McAmis sent a friend a text message in which he stated that he was now parked at a pull-off on “The Dragon,” which is a portion of United States Route 129. He told his friend that he was struggling to breathe and that he was passing the information along to him. That is the last known communication that he had with another individual, according to the BCSO.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpws8CrqZ6spGK6pK3Moqpmp5Kewbat0bJkpKafrcOquMueZK2mXZe8pcWMqJ1mpZmowKq6xmZocWWpmq6zec6lm2aen6q7pXnDnpidZZmjeqS0yKWfqK%2BVmnqtrcqeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
