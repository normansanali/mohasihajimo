In her interview with <a href=#>Country Stars Centra</a>l, Peggy Sue noted that Crystal was born in Paintsville, Kentucky, but said of Crystal's childhood outside of Butcher Hollow, "I always say that's why she's different! ... You know and they get prettier with more practice that they've had!" Per <a href=#>Biography</a>, the Webbs relocated to Wabash, Indiana when Crystal was 4 years old. Known for her striking good looks and nearly floor-length hair as well as her singing, Crystal started performing when she was young, singing backup for her brother's band and joining Loretta on tour. In 1970, she released the <a href=#>Loretta Lynn</a>-penned song ""I've Cried (The Blues Right Out of My Eyes)," which was a Top 40 country hit.&nbsp;</p><p>Gayle released several more songs on the Decca label before leaving for United Artists and releasing her first, self-titled album. The move was a positive one, with the song "Wrong Road Again" reaching the Top 10 on the country charts. Her follow-up album, "We Must Believe In Magic," contained her signature hit "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue," which was a crossover smash, reaching No. 1 on the country charts and No. 2 on the pop charts. Gayle won the Grammy for best female country vocal performance and became the very first female country performer to earn a platinum record.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j2xvb2hiZLCwwc2tqbJlnarAqq%2BMq6ynq12eu27Ax55kn5mdnrm6ecWoqWakn6eytcDAZqOypp6oerS10q2cq6tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
