On Sunday, October 29th, as she made her way to work, Aleksis was involved in a car accident that took her from us far too soon. At just 18 years old, she had her entire life ahead of her, but sometimes, as they say, God needs his angels back sooner than we can understand. The weight of this loss has left us all utterly devastated and heartbroken.</p><p>Aleksis was not only our daughter but also a cherished sister, friend, and co-worker who left an indelible mark on those fortunate enough to know her. Her bright, loving, and kindhearted nature had the power to light up any room. While working as a server, she was also committed to her education, attending college full-time to pursue her dream of becoming an aesthetician, with aspirations of one day owning her own spa where she could help others feel and look beautiful.</p><p>The pain of this loss is especially acute for her two older sisters, who not only lost their sister but also their closest confidante and best friend. The loss of a child is an unimaginable burden for any family to bear. In this trying time, our primary focus is to uplift and support Alex, Becky, and their girls with our collective prayers.</p><p>If you find it within your means to provide financial assistance, your generosity and kindness would be greatly appreciated. Your contribution will help alleviate some of the financial burdens the family faces during this time of immense grief, allowing them the space to mourn and heal without the added strain of financial worries.</p><p>Aleksis’s memory will forever shine in our hearts, and together, we can honor her spirit by extending love, support, and compassion to her family as they navigate this incredibly challenging journey of loss and healing.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwrcueoqyho2K6orfSoqSyrZtivKO1066Yq7Fdlrmmt9KiqmalkaDAqrnYrqJmoJGoeqW1xJ1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
