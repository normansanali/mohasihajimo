In his lawsuit, he claimed Diddy once “bragged” about employing sex workers and named Joy <a href=#>as one of the alleged sex workers</a>, alleging she received a monthly allowance from Diddy.</p><p class=p1>Diddy, through his attorney, denied all of Jones’ accusations.</p><p class=p1>“Lil Rod is nothing more than a liar who filed a $30 million lawsuit, shamelessly looking for an undeserved payday,” Diddy’s lawyer <strong>Shawn Holley</strong> told <i>Us Weekly </i>in a statement. “His reckless name-dropping about events that are pure fiction and simply did not happen is nothing more than a transparent attempt to garner headlines.”</p><p class=p1>Holley continued: “We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies. We will address these outlandish allegations in court and take all appropriate action against those who make them.”</p><p class=p1>50 Cent had previously insinuated via his Instagram that he was unaware of Joy’s alleged sex work past. (Joy has not publicly addressed the claims. <i>Us </i>reached out for comment.)</p><p class=p1>“I didn’t know you was a sex worker, you little sex worker. LOL this s—t is a movie,” 50 Cent wrote via Instagram in March 2024, seemingly referring to Joy.</p><p class=p1>Keep scrolling to learn more about Joy:</p><h3 class=p7><b>What Does Daphne Joy Do for a Living?</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Who-Is-Daphne-Joy-5-Things-to-Know-About-50-Cent-Ex-Who-Was-Named-in-Diddy-Lawsuit-4.jpg><p class=p1>Joy is an actress and model, booking cameos in movies <i>Frankenhood, Venice Heat, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides </i>and <i>Setup. </i>She has also launched her own eponymous fashion line.</p><p class=p1>“Designing pieces with a women’s curves and comfort in mind, has always been a dream of mine,” a description on the brand’s website reads. “Striking, minimally bold, classic silhouettes will always be the intention behind every piece.

They have since remained relatively quiet about their relationship status.</p><p class=p1>“Since I’ve been in the industry, I’ve learnt to be a very private person and not to take things so personally,” Joy previously told <i>Esquire Malaysia </i>in December 2013. “When people are interested in you, whether it’s good or bad, they’re going to dig up whatever they want.”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time, “It’s up to you to have your game face on always, and not to make a bigger spectacle of the situation than it is. Everyone goes through hardships and obstacles. It’s just unfortunate that some people have to go through it with such a big magnifying glass over them … but with me, because I have such a loving family, they’ve kept me so grounded and together that I don’t ever feel alone. If it gets overwhelming, I really just go to my mum and my dad. They just keep me together.”</p><p class=p1>A source exclusively told <i>Us </i>in March 2024 that 50 Cent, who also shares estranged son Marquise with ex <strong>Shaniqua Tompkins</strong>, was <a href=#>seeking sole custody</a> of Sire in light of the sex trafficking allegations.</p><h3 class=p7><b>How Is Daphne Joy Involved in Sex Trafficking Lawsuit Against Diddy?</b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Who-Is-Daphne-Joy-5-Things-to-Know-About-50-Cent-Ex-Who-Was-Named-in-Diddy-Lawsuit-6.jpg><p class=p1>Joy is one of the alleged sex workers who used to get a “monthly stipend” from Diddy, according to Jones’ February 2024 lawsuit.
