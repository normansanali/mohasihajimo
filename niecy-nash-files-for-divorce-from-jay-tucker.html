Our truth is that in this season of our lives, we are better friends than partners in marriage,” the estranged couple said in a joint statement shared on <a href=#>Nash’s Instagram account</a>. “Our union was such a gorgeous ride. And as we go our separate ways now, we feel fortunate for the love we share – present tense. Thank you all out there for your support of us as a couple over the last eight years. We are grateful.”</p><p>Nash’s <a href=#>marriage to the electrical engineer</a> was her second trip down the aisle.

There was a beautiful sign written in calligraphy that said ‘Congratulations’ on construction paper.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The second time around, the Getting On star had her road down the aisle documented for a TLC special in order to connect with her fans and get some advice.</p><p>“They have been so wonderful with passing along some of their business,” Niecy explained about the response she received after posting a notice on her website for support. “The main thing I want women to know is that you can get a second chance. You can get a do-over. Through this show, I want to tell them that the first time you fall in love doesn’t have to be the last time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZWYxm66wKyfZp6ZobK0ecWoqWacmau8s6%2FEZp2rp51it6LFjK2snKOVp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
