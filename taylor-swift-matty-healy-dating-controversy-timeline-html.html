Eight years after they were first linked in the press, Swift and the 1975 singer <a href=#>Matty Healy</a> were finally, actually dating — and have now broken up just as quickly, <a href=#>per a new TMZ report</a>. <a href=#>Their relationship</a>, which was first reported by The Sun on May 3, felt both impossible and inevitable. On top of their history, the two share some mutual friends (most notably Jack Antonoff, who produced both of their recent albums). And like Swift, Healy is both comfortable with his fame and interested in playing with it; he’s already pulled more than one cheeky stunt to flick at their relationship. (Healy is also, as Swift has professed to love, a London boy.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clic6vgzd00173g6ha9v9kofi@published data-word-count=142>But Healy doesn’t exactly have the precisely manicured public image that one would expect from Taylor Swift’s Boyfriend. (Not even his track record of talking about Swift is clean.) He’s made something of a brand out of controversial statements, which has recently come back to bite him amid a podcast appearance where he was part of multiple racist and sexist discussions. One of those was at the expense of Ice Spice, whom he apologized to, and who’s now featured on a new Swift remix. Through it all, Healy quickly became <a href=#>Swift’s most-discussed boyfriend in ages</a>, with some fans criticizing their relationship and even questioning their fandom. And that was all happening against the backdrop of Swift’s biggest album cycle and tour ever. It’s unclear what led to the split, but a friend told TMZ on June 5 that Swift is now “single.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clic756vu001b3g6hv5ok17xg@published data-word-count=31>Like it or not, there’s a lot to catch up on.

I am NOT being Taylor Swift’s boyfriend.’ You know, ‘FUCK. THAT.’” Healy also refers to their history as “a flirtation,” effectively confirming there was some romance at the time. He also goes on to admit he doesn’t understand Swift’s fame. “It’s not really anything to talk about, because if she wasn’t Taylor Swift we wouldn’t be talking about her,” he says. “She wasn’t a big impact on my life. It’s just interesting to me how interested the world is about Taylor Swift.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cli4pww1l00cd3g6hzyh6z7fj@published data-word-count=210><strong>March 18, 2016:</strong> After immediate and strong backlash to his quotes, Healy <a href=#>clarifies</a> himself on Twitter. “Now I may admit to being an idiot on occasion, but I am not a misogynist,” he writes. “This suggestion makes me really sad.” He goes on to explain he was “being HONEST” about his feelings about being constantly associated with “the most famous woman on the planet.” He also clarifies multiple times that he never dated Swift, but adds of her, “I found her to be one of the most gracious, hard-working, creatively gifted, and beautiful women that I have had the pleasure to meet. I personally have a lot of respect and admiration for her. Why would I not?” That same day, the Q writer, Laura Barton, defends Healy <a href=#>in a column</a> for The Guardian. She writes that his comment was “an afterthought” that she did not expect to be controversial at the time. “Healy is an intelligent and liberal man, with a substantial and evolved insight into the world of women — he obviously adores them and wants to be adored by them, he has clearly had some fairly formidable female role models in his life,” she writes. “And yet even he wrestles with these culturally entrenched views of gender roles.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clibz26k500nz3g6hns2llr1c@published data-word-count=24><strong>April 29, 2016:</strong> Harris and Rihanna release “This Is What You Came For,” which credits Swift as a co-writer under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cli3nlzm900963g6h6sngoz7k@published data-word-count=61><strong>October 2016:</strong> Following relationships with Harris and actor Tom Hiddleston, Swift begins dating British actor Joe Alwyn.

He goes on to suggest an idea for Swift’s next album that he’d discussed with Beats 1 host Zane Lowe: an “intimate” acoustic album in the vein of Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska. And Healy adds that he’d like to produce it. “Taylor, if you ever want someone to help you set up the mics for your acoustic record, just so you know, I’m there,” he says.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cli3okjfe00ap3g6h4afpy7oc@published data-word-count=64><strong>February 12, 2020:</strong> Healy and Swift see each other for the first time “in years,” as he will later say, <a href=#>when she makes a surprise appearance at the NME Awards</a>.
