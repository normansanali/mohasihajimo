Now, the organization has officially removed cannabis from its revised list of prohibited substances for athletes. This historic update builds upon prior reforms within the organization, and it showcases the UFC's commitment to protecting the health and safety of its athletes while ensuring fair competition. Let's delve into the details of marijuana use in the UFC in 2024.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>UFC's Prohibited Substance List</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The UFC's prohibited substance list aligns with the framework established by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). However, despite WADA's maintenance of cannabis as a banned substance, the UFC has made adjustments based on historical findings and removed marijuana from the prohibited list. This decision demonstrates the UFC's progressive approach to anti-doping policies and its dedication to creating fair and equal circumstances for all athletes.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>California State Athletic Commission's Rules</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While the UFC has removed marijuana from its list of prohibited substances, professional fighters competing in California could still face penalties if they test positive for THC over a certain limit ahead of an event. The California State Athletic Commission has set a threshold of 150 nanograms of THC per milliliter, and fighters who exceed this limit may be subject to a $100 fine.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite the legalization of marijuana for adults in California, the commission is responsible for ensuring the safety of licensees before, during, and after a combat event. Therefore, any competitor who tests over the WADA threshold of 150 ng/ml can be subject to the fine, regardless of the established threshold.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>UFC's Guidance to Fighters</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In light of the California State Athletic Commission's rules, the UFC has advised fighters to discontinue marijuana use immediately to avoid exceeding the THC threshold ahead of events in California. Fighters have been cautioned to adhere to these guidelines to ensure they don't face penalties for testing positive for THC.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Recent Reforms and Legalization Movement</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The removal of marijuana from the UFC's list of prohibited substances aligns with the broader trend of reforms within sports organizations regarding marijuana testing policies for athletes. Several sports organizations have moved to amend their marijuana testing policies, and there have been significant developments in the legalization of marijuana across various states in the United States.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>For example, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and its players union signed a collective bargaining agreement that removes marijuana from the leagueâ€™s banned substances list, signaling a shift in the approach to cannabis use among professional athletes. Moreover, the National Football League (NFL) has also undergone changes to its drug testing policy as part of a collective bargaining agreement, highlighting the evolving stance on marijuana use in professional sports.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While marijuana has been removed from the UFC's list of prohibited substances, professional fighters still need to be aware of the specific rules and regulations in the states where they compete. The California State Athletic Commission's THC threshold and the potential penalties for exceeding it serve as a reminder that despite the legalization of marijuana in certain jurisdictions, athletes must adhere to the rules set forth by the relevant athletic commissions. The UFC's proactive approach to anti-doping policies and its alignment with broader reforms within the sports industry indicate a shift toward more progressive and comprehensive approaches to marijuana use among professional athletes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0misn5tfnsBuucCroKOtkaOubrXLpZygmZxitq9506GcZq2WmHqquoxrZ2ts</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
