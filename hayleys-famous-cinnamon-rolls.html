These are seriously the BEST cinnamon rolls ever. I have tested and tested and tested again a lot of recipes and these famous cinnamon rolls take the top prize.</p><p>This makes a LARGE batch of cinnamon rolls. Feel free to half the recipe if you want to make only 7-8 cinnamon rolls.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/DSC_0737-copy.jpg alt="Hayley's Famous Cinnamon Rolls.

This ensures that it is always fresh and ready for baked goods. I have many stories of bad yeast that never activates even with warm water or milk and sugar.&nbsp; You can tell if your yeast is fresh by watching it start to activate and foam.&nbsp; You start to see bubbles and movement.&nbsp; Sugar is a big contributor to activating the yeast. I always throw some sugar into the yeast mixture as it proofs to help expedite the process.</li><p><strong>2. Let it rise in a warm oven, turned off.</strong>&nbsp; This is a key trick to getting your yeast bread or rolls to rise.&nbsp; Weather can be tricky when getting your bread or rolls to rise.&nbsp; You can be in not ideal conditions.&nbsp; The trick is to let your oven do the work. It expedites the process because a warm oven creates an environment conducive for yeast rolls. Turn your oven to 200 degrees and let it heat up.&nbsp; Once it reaches 200 degrees, turn it off. Place your cinnamon roll dough in an oven-safe bowl and place in the oven for 1 hour.&nbsp; It should rise to at least double the size. It saves you at least an hour of rising time!</p><p><strong>3. Watch for the flour to come off the sides of the mixing bowl.&nbsp;</strong>When you are making any type of yeast bread, I always add flour in increments and not the entire amount at once. I wait for it to start to come off the sides of the bowl and form in the center. That is a big clue that it is ready.&nbsp; In this particular recipe, I add 3 cups of flour at a time and mix it for 30 seconds in between. I usually end up with 8 1/2 – 9 cups of flour every single time.</p><p><strong>4. Make sure you have enough filling.</strong>&nbsp;The brown sugar, cinnamon, butter filling is where all of the warm, spiced flavors come from so you want to be generous.&nbsp; Feel free to add a little more brown sugar or butter if you want a little extra filling. Spread to evenly coat the entire rectangle.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hayleys-Famous-Cinnamon-Rolls-Dough.jpg alt="Hayley's Famous Cinnamon Rolls.

After you have rolled out the dough and cut into slices, let the cinnamon rolls rise for the 2nd time.&nbsp;</strong>This is when it gets fun as you start to see the cinnamon rolls become large and amazing. Let the cinnamon rolls rise for one hour on a baking pan.</p><p><strong>6. Bake until lightly golden brown and cooked through.</strong>&nbsp;This can be tricky. If your oven tends to heat up hotter in the back, then turn the baking sheet halfway through the baking time. Watch for your rolls to get a nice light golden color and remove from oven. Let cool slightly before adding frosting.</p><p><strong>7. Spread with a good amount of cream cheese and butter frosting.&nbsp;</strong>This quite possibly could be the BEST part of the cinnamon roll. Don’t skimp on the frosting. Cover these babies with a generous coat of cream cheese frosting.&nbsp; The combination of butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla makes a phenomenal, creamy frosting.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hayleys-Famous-Cinnamon-Rolls-6.jpg alt="Hayley's Famous Cinnamon Rolls.
