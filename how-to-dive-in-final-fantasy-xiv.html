You might be asked to jump into the water and dive when you’re playing through the Main Scenario quests or working on the side quests. The underwater swimming feature is not entirely intuitive and can be difficult to do correctly. Here’s what you need to know about how to dive and what it does in Final Fantasy XIV.</p><h2>How diving works in Final Fantasy XIV</h2><p data-injection=true>You’ll want to make your way into the water, typically around where your quest is located or if you’re merely swimming around and investigating an area; regardless, make sure you’re in the water. When you’re there, the only thing you need to do now is click Ctrl and the Space Bar simultaneously. Your character will perform a quick dive into the water, and then you’ll be able to swim around freely. If you’re playing on a controller, click the O button while swimming.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/24174712/Final-Fantasy-XIV-Diving-850x478.jpg><p data-injection=true>Your character will explore the area in any direction and can move in every direction possible. They won’t be moving as quickly as they could on land, but it’s not a significant difference in speed.</p><p>You’ll need to dive for several Main Scenario quests, but it’s easy to forget the proper controls you need to select to jump straight into the water. You will also need to dive underwater while on your Island Sanctuary. Here, you will need to gather underwater resources to bring back to your cabin. There are a handful of resources you will need to find this way, such as Squid, Clams, Jellyfish, Coral, and more. You will want to get use to diving under the water to find these resources while visiting your Island Sanctuary.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
