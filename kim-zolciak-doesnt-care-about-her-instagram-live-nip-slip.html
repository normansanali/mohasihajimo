When asked by a viewer the reality star if she’s been more careful with what she wears on Instagram Live, the Don’t Be Tardy star replied, “She’s exaggerating. And my <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nipples</a> are so good that I didn’t even care. So, oops!”</p><p>Host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> asked her to elaborate on what she meant. “My boobs are great,” she continued. “I paid for them, they’re amazing, they’re great. So I had the nip slip, it looks great, so whoops.”</p><p>Not only did she not notice at the time, but she said she hardly notices when rewatching it. “I didn’t know, I had my bathrobe on, I was just doing a Live, I leaned forward to grab a piece of paper. People were telling me but I honestly rewatched it and never saw it. So I was like, ‘Oh, whatever,’ I left it up. Dumb.”</p><p><a href=# rel>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</a> star has always been quite candid when it comes to body. When her daughter <strong>Ariana</strong> was struggling with some body insecurities while shopping for a prom dress in February last year, she pointed to her mom in frustration and said, “Your stomach is like a size 4!”</p><p>However, Kim quipped back, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I paid for a stomach!</a>” She then tried to comfort Ariana, telling her, “You’re beautiful. I love you. You’re beautiful the way you are. You have to accept yourself.”</p><p>There’s nothing like a little <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">prom dress</a> shopping session to teach a valuable lesson on self-love!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6C2rnnZqKOcoZGgeqW7xKylrWWTlr%2BmecCbpq6sXZ2ys3nIp6qtmZenrq55y6KtnmWenr1uv8uip2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
