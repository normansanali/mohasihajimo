It just feels right.”</p><p>Ventsislavova then told Amato “you can watch it” before adding a shrugging emoji.</p><p>The records also contain a Jan. 4 note detailing an ultimatum given to Amato by his parents, Chad and Margaret Amato, mandating that he immediately end his “preoccupation” with Ventsislavova, get a job and repay the $200,000 he owed his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/grant-amato-records3.jpg><p>“But family does not expect this possibility,” according to the note, which also gave Amato the option of joining the military, particularly the Air Force.</p><p>The two-page note, which was marked up with a yellow highlighter, also warned that Amato could expect no more financial help from his family if he failed to meet the obligations.</p><p>“This is a promise — you better heed the warning — it’s real,” the note read.</p><p>Three weeks later, the bodies of Amato’s parents, as well as his brother Cody, were found shot to death in their home after Chad Amato discovered Grant was still talking with Ventsislavova, leading to a fight at the family’s home, <a href=# rel=noopener>the Orlando Sentinel reports</a>.</p><p>Grant Amato, who has pleaded not guilty in what police have called “execution-style” shootings of his family, remains held on $750,000. A judge has barred him from using funds from his parents’ estate for his bond, leading him to <a href=# rel=noopener>seek out a kind-hearted millionaire who might get him out of jail</a>.</p><p>Amato’s trial is expected to start in July. If convicted on three counts of premeditated first-degree murder, he could face the death penalty, the Sentinel reports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7j25mbGhfp7Kku9GdqmaqlauyoriMppinq12kr7Sx0qygqKZdrLa1tIybrKWfkae2orqMnJimn5mnuW6uxJ%2Bmq51dlrmtscaem6WxXaC2rbjIp55moJmoeqetzKKjsmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
