My soul knows him, I feel like. He’s <a href=#>my best friend in the entire world</a>. And no matter what, if I’m having the worst day ever, I feel like I have somebody who understands me. And even if he doesn’t quite understand me at that moment, he tries to,” she raved at the time. “And that feels so nice.”</p><p>She added that she was most looking forward to “making him my husband” and “putting a ring on his finger” when the couple tied the knot.</p><p>Parrish — who will next appear in Tiger this fall and Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists in 2019 — paid tribute to the chemical engineer on August 29. “This guy right here is the epitome of strength, kindness and love no matter what the circumstance,” she gushed on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “I’m super lucky I found him and get to marry his ass.”</p><p>The&nbsp;To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before&nbsp;star celebrated a relationship milestone the week before the pair’s wedding. “Two years with you and I still can’t get enough,” she captioned an Instagram video of the duo on Monday, September 3. “<a href=#>Happy Anniversary</a>, @c_long.
