It's so beautifully written by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Elizabeth Strout (<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Olive Kitteridge</a>). It centers around a woman named Lucy, who is a writer, mother, wife, and daughter. An extended hospital stay has her thoughtfully examining many significant relationships in her life, but most importantly, taking a closer look at her estranged mom who turns up for a visit. Are our childhood memories truthful? This book is about memories and love.

It's not a light read, but his account of his neurosurgery training leading up to his own diagnosis with terminal lung cancer is intense, moving, and inspiring.

Her descriptive storytelling and 3-D characters are as alive as ever in modern-day London, and I can't wait to dive into the second book in the series, The Silkworm. Riding high after the success of their first case together, detective Cormoran Strike and his trusty secretary, Robin, are hired to solve a missing persons case that is more than meets the eye.
