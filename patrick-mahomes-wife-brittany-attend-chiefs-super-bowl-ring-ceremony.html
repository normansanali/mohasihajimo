February’s victory marked the first time that Missouri team won twice in a row. In 2023, the Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles — including tight end <strong>Travis Kelce</strong>’s brother, <strong>Jason Kelce</strong> — while they played the San Francisco 49ers this year.</p><p class=p1>While Patrick led the Chiefs to another victory at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium in February, Brittany <a href=#>watched from the stands</a> with the couple’s two kids — Sterling, 3, and Bronze, 17 months — and the quarterback’s family. The crew made their way onto the field to celebrate the win.</p><p class=p1>“It means the world that [they’re here],” Patrick <a href=#>gushed to reporters</a> at the time. “The whole family of Kansas City [and the] Chiefs Kingdom is special.
