I have shared several sugar cookie recipes — <a href=#>Christmas Sugar Cookies</a> and <a href=#>Frosted Soft and Chewy Sugar Cookies</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Best-Soft-Sugar-Cookies-7-crop.jpg><p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center block-tip__title has-x-large-font-size">What makes this the Best Soft Sugar Cookie Recipe?</h2></p><p>This is a super <strong>easy, drop sugar cookie recipe</strong>. <strong>No rolling</strong>. <strong>No shaping</strong>. <strong>No cutting into shapes.

Let cool.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Best-Soft-Sugar-Cookies-13-crop-scaled.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why does the sugar cookie dough need to be chilled?</h2><p>Chilling the dough is essential for preventing the cookies from spreading too much during baking. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour or overnight. This also allows the flavors to meld, and the dry ingredients to soak up some of the wet ingredients, and allowing the flavor to richen and deepen.</p><p>I did recipe test this without chilling and they still tasted delicious but were flatter without the chilling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Best-Soft-Sugar-Cookies-5.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why are my sugar cookies flat?</h2><p>The sugar cookies may turn out too flat for several reasons. I would suggest using barely softened room temperature butter. You don’t want it to be too soft and definitely not melted! Also, make sure to measure the flour correctly.</p><p>The cookie dough may need to chill longer to help prevent the sugar cookies from spreading too much in the oven.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Best-Soft-Sugar-Cookies-6-crop.jpg><p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center block-tip__title has-x-large-font-size">5 EXPERT BAKING TIPS:</h2></p><p>Now, let’s move on to the tips that will elevate your sugar cookie game. This is such a quick and easy sugar cookie recipe but little tips can make all of the difference.</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Soften the Butter Properly</strong></p><p>Softening butter is a crucial step in achieving the perfect sugar cookie texture. Allow the butter to come to room temperature for optimal softness. You should be able to press your finger into the butter easily, but it should still hold its shape. Don’t melt the butter.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: Cream the Butter and Sugar</strong></p><p>Creaming the butter and sugar together creates air pockets that contribute to the sugar cookies soft and chewy texture. Beat the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes 3-4 minutes.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Use the Right Amount of Flour</strong></p><p>Measure your flour accurately to avoid a dry or crumbly texture. Too much flour can make your cookies dense and dry. Spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a flat edge.</p><p><strong>Tip 4: Chill the Dough</strong></p><p>Chilling the dough is essential for preventing the cookies from spreading too much during baking. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1-2 hours or overnight.</p><p><strong>Tip 5: Don’t Overbake</strong></p><p>Overbaking is the enemy of soft and chewy sugar cookies. Keep a close eye on your cookies and remove them from the oven as soon as the edges are set but the centers are still slightly soft. The sugar cookies will continue to firm up as they cool. I love to sprinkle the sugar cookies with sparkling sugar as soon as I remove them from the oven.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Best-Soft-Sugar-Cookies-3-scaled.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where to find sparkling sugar?</h3><p>Sparkling sugar can be called sanding sugar or shimmer sugar as well. You can find it in the baking aisle at your local grocery store or online.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Making Ahead, Storing, and Freezing:</h2><p>Store sugar cookies in an airtight container in order for them to stay soft and chewy.</p><p><strong>CAN SUGAR COOKIES BE FROZEN?</strong></p><p>Yes! You can freeze both the cookies and the cookie dough. You can chill the dough before baking the cookies by freezing the cookie dough balls on a baking sheet until firm. Then put them in a Ziploc freezer-safe bag until ready to bake. When ready to bake, place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake for 1 minute longer.</p><p>To freeze already baked sugar cookies, let them cool completely and then place them in a Ziploc freezer-safe bag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Best-Soft-Sugar-Cookies-10-crop-scaled.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Can I use salted butter in this sugar cookie recipe?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Yes! If you use salted butter in this recipe, just reduce the salt to 1/8 teaspoon in the recipe. I suggest using unsalted butter to control the amount of salt in the sugar cookie recipe, but you can use salted butter, no problem.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>How do I make my cookies perfectly round?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>To make the cookies perfectly round, as soon as you remove the cookies from the oven, use a large round cookie cutter or biscuit cutter and place it around the cookie and move it around until it forms a round circle. You can also use a small turner and press the edges towards the center of the cookie to make a uniform circle.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>How do I know when my sugar cookies are done baking?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Since oven temperatures can vary, it is important to watch the cookies carefully. Once the sugar cookies have started to form an edge and have a very light golden color, you can remove them from the oven. DO NOT OVERBAKE! These are soft and chewy sugar cookies so they will be slightly underbaked when you remove them from the oven and they will continue to set up once you remove them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Popular Cookie Recipes:</h2><p>Here are some crowd-pleasing cookie recipes…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Best-Soft-and-Chewy-Sugar-Cookies-Recipe.jpg><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=33843 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/best-soft-sugar-cookies/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=8><li id=wprm-recipe-33878-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=1><p><span>In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter and sugar for 4 minutes or until light and fluffy.
