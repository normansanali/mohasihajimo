In 1760, his great-grandfather, and namesake, founded P. Lorillard and Company in New York City to process tobacco, cigars, and snuff. Today, Lorillard Tobacco Company is the oldest tobacco company in the U.S. Pierre Lorillard married Emily Taylor (b. January 21, 1841) in 1858 with whom he had four children; she was the daughter of Isaac Ebenezer Taylor (b. 1815) and Eliza Mary Mollan Taylor (d. 1867). He is the step-grandfather of the artist Peter Hill Beard.</p><p>In the early 1880s, Lorillard helped make Newport, Rhode Island a yachting center with his schooner <i>Vesta</i> and a steam yacht <i>Radha.</i> He owned a summer estate in Newport called “The Breakers”, which he sold to Cornelius Vanderbilt II in 1882 in order to use his newly developed estate, the Tuxedo Club, at what became known as Tuxedo Park in Orange County, New York. Lorillard had inherited 13,000 acres (53&nbsp;km²) around Tuxedo Lake, which he developed in conjunction with William Waldorf Astor and other wealthy associates into a luxury retreat. Lorillard hired famed architect Bruce Price to design his clubhouse and the many “cottages” of the era along with landscape architect Arthur P. Kroll, in 1929. Lorillard was also a member of the Jekyll Island Club, also known as The Millionaires Club.</p><p>While it has been reported that Lorillard’s son, Griswold Lorillard, introduced the then-unnamed tuxedo to the United States in 1886 at the Tuxedo Club’s Autumn Ball, this is now known to be incorrect. While Griswold and his friends did create a stir by wearing unorthodox clothing, their jackets were closer to tailcoats without tails, or what would now be called a mess jacket.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=thoroughbred-racing></span><span id=Thoroughbred_racing>Thoroughbred racing</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>An avid sportsman, Pierre Lorillard and his brother, George Lyndes Lorillard, were both major figures in thoroughbred horse racing. In 1874, Pierre Lorillard’s horse, Saxon, won the Belmont Stakes. Although his horse Parole finished fourth in the 1876 Kentucky Derby, it went on to race with considerable success both in the United States and in Europe. In the 19th century, shipping horses from New York to Louisville, Kentucky was a major undertaking and because back then both the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes were both held in the New York City area, neither of the Lorillard brothers raced again in the Derby. Pierre Lorillard established Rancocas Stable, named for the New Jersey town where Lorillard owned a country house. He spent time in Paris and in England where, in 1881, his horse Iroquois became the first American-owned and bred horse to win a European classic race. Ridden by the champion English jockey, Fred Archer, Iroquois won the Epsom Derby then went on to capture the St. Leger Stakes as well. Lorillard had other successes in England, notably with the horse named for the actor David Garrick, who won the 1901 Chester Cup ridden by American jockey, Danny Maher.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=exploration></span><span id=Exploration>Exploration</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Beyond his interest in racehorses, Lorillard was a scholar who financed the Central American expedition of the French archaeologist Désiré Charnay and his publication of “<i>The Ancient Cities of the New World. Being Travels and Explorations in Mexico and Central America from 1857–1882</i>.” For making the project possible, the government of France awarded Lorillard the Legion of Honor. Charnay named some Maya ruins “Lorillard City” in his honor, but the name did not stick, and the site is better known as Yaxchilan. Lorillard also helped finance some of the explorations of Augustus Le Plongeon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=death></span><span id=Death>Death</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pierre Lorillard died in 1901, aged 67, and was interred in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. His wife Emily died in 1925 and was interred next to him.</p><p>Lorillard Place in The Bronx is named for him and his brother George.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=children></span><span id=Children>Children</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Emily Lorillard</li><li>Pierre Lorillard V</li><li>Nathaniel Griswold Lorillard</li><li>Maude Louise Lorillard, later Baroness Revelstoke (1876 London – 2 April 1922 London) married firstly 15 April 1893 (divorced) T.
