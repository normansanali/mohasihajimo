Times</a> reported in April 2018 that Goff was moving on up from his starter home in Agoura Hills, <a href=#>California</a>, in search of the bigger and the better. When you're a Pro Bowl QB, your "starter" home is a measly $1.8 million shack, and soon it's time for an upgrade. Because really, it was only 4,315 square feet with five bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms, multiple fireplaces, high ceilings, and a game room, and a man really needs to be able to stretch his legs after a hard day's work on the gridiron.</p><p>So he moved the Goff family operation to the gated "city" of Hidden Hills, California, where he bought a 4,992-square-foot home for just over $4 million. His top-notch corner property spreads for about 1.24 acres. The swimming pool is actually kind of basic for houses in the area.</p><p>But if Goff ever starts to feel cooped up, he need not worry. He can always head out to his $5.8 million beach house in Hermosa Beach, California. The 3,282-square-foot home is just a block away from the <a href=#>ocean</a>. Velvet Ropes says that the house was bought off-market, so not much is known in the way of specifics, but the developer is known for a "contemporary take on interior decor, with chic gourmet kitchens and open-plan living spaces, plus plenty of large windows for an abundance of natural light."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FkGpnb3Bfn66zscNmnqielmLEqbHRnmSdp5WoerW0xGapmqWjYr6jecuirZ5lkaOxbrTOsGSesKCau7S11Z5koqtdnba0eceorKydXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
