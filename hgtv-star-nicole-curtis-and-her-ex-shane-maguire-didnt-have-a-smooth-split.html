In August 2016, Curtis reportedly didn’t want Harper to spend the night at Maguire’s until he was over age two, causing Maguire to file an amendment to the court-issued agreement. He noted that she would often take the toddler with her on trips, allegedly so he didn’t have to go to his dad’s. Maguire filed for missed parenting time and claimed that Curtis kept him from seeing his son.</p><p>Ultimately, the judge agreed with him, and Curtis had to pay for both legal fees incurred and any time Maguire missed with Harper to which he was entitled. By 2017, the couple’s trials were still not smoothed over. Maguire filed yet another motion that year, his sixth concerning Harper, alleging that Curtis was repeatedly denying him parenting time again, violating previous court orders. It didn’t help that he lived in Minnesota while Curtis was residing in Michigan, a move she made not long after Harper’s birth.</p><p>For her part, Curtis cited not wanting her toddler to be on an airplane to regularly visit Maguire. In addition, the “Rehab Addict” star spoke out about how she advocated for her choice to continue breastfeeding Harper, something her former partner believed was a tactic to prevent him from having time with his son. Shockingly, the two parents somehow avoided a full-blown trial and successfully drafted a joint custody agreement in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooJepw26%2F05qpZqaZmLytsYycrKusmah6orrDZp%2Beql2axW6%2Fx5qlnmWdlrS2tdGeZJ2hlKPBbrTAr5xmmV2ourC706FkrKicnsFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
