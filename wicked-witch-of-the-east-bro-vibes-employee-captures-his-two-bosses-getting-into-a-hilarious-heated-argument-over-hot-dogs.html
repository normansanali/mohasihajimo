During the memeable clip, one man shouts “Wicked Witch of the East, bro” — a quotable line which eventually made its rounds all over the internet. Flash forward to now, and a mind-blowing argument over hot dogs has suddenly jogged our memories and brought back that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vivacious Vine energy</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>The altercation was posted over on <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a></strong>, where one user shared a gut-busting argument between his bosses on the platform. In the clip, the OP recorded himself smiling in the back seat of the car as his two bosses in the front seats debated whether or not a human mouth could fit 6 hot dogs into it. While one boss was adamant the trick could be done, the other boss was much more aggressive in making his point that the jaw would break before 6 hot dogs could fit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@mikejones882 href=#>@mikejones882</a><p><a title=work href=#>#work</a> <a title=shutthefuckupgerald href=#>#shutthefuckupgerald</a> <a title=angryboss href=#>#angryboss</a> <a title=mad href=#>#mad</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Mike Jones" href=#>♬ original sound – Mike Jones</a></figure><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>The entire argument might seem incredibly silly to the outside eye, but when you step back and remember that particular Vine where those guys were debating The Wizard of Oz, then it certainly doesn’t seem that shocking to know that similar arguments are being had on TikTok. After all, most folks would agree that TikTok is this decade’s Vine.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>More than that, the argument doesn’t seem too silly seeing as the actual facts surrounding mouth expansion is pretty interesting. As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MyHealth</a>, the normal measurement of mouth opening in the average person is 30–50 mm, although some individuals can have a reduced mouth opening with just a 20 mm measurement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLXCpJydZaeewaS0jKidZqyYmnqmrdKtZJuqn2LDqq7ErGSepaChvLqxxGaamqikqr%2Bmv4yhoKxlpKy8bq7OrKqeq12csrXAyKeeZqGeqbxurYyhoKWZop68tr%2BMoZyarJWZeqK%2Bxq6knqakYry3sdFmn6isXZm8qL%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
