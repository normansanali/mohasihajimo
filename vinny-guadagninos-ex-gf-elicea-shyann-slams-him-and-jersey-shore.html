The model slammed the reality star — and the show — in a series of since-deleted Instagram posts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/146575_os_0750_jersey-shore-zoom.jpg><p>“Here’s some free promotion!!!! for the trash everyone loves to watch. I’m a real f—king person who wakes up DAILY to more and more bulls—t and heartache,” Shyann wrote on Saturday, May 19, alongside a clip from the Thursday, May 17 episode of<a href=#> Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.</a> “Enjoy the f—king show that is my f—king life. Ppl wonder how ppl end up in the darkest places. Here’s your answer.”</p><p>Shyann dated the MTV star throughout the filming of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, but&nbsp;Guadagnino announced they had split last month. On Saturday, she also shared a series of photos from the course of their relationship.</p><p>“Humiliation disrespect zero empathy lol it’s truly AMAZING,” Shyann wrote on her since-deleted Instagram posts. “Everyone lives for the drama watching good things go to s—t.”</p><p>Shyann appears to be referring to Guadagnino’s behavior on the series, which included flirting with a stripper and getting two bottle-service waitresses’ phone numbers.</p><p>“The waitress is like my wife. Oh, I loved her so much,” he said on the ride home from the club during Thursday’s episode. “Me and my girl are going to marry her.”</p><p>The following morning, Guadagnino called Shyann from Miami and confessed about the night before.</p><p>“But if I got a guys number, would you f—king like it?” Shyann quipped. “With your girlfriend at home, getting a b—itches’ number out doesn’t look good for you.”</p><p>Guadagnino has yet to respond to Shyann’s comments, but did promote the episode before it aired on Thursday via <a href=#>Instagram</a>, writing, “HAPPY JERZDAY! Brand NEW episode of&nbsp;#JSFamilyVacationTONIGHT filled with strippers,blue balls, many bottles of vodka mixed with scantily clad women all around me, and even some cross dressing . The funny thing is I’m not lying about any of that . Tune in tonight at 8PM on&nbsp;@mtv!&nbsp;#YouCheated.”</p><p>He also opened up to Us Weekly on April 4 about their relationship.</p><p>“We’re actually not together right now. I love her. She’s a great girl. Long distance… She’s in California and I live in New York. It’s just too hard to keep up. I don’t regret anything. I really care about the girl. A simple girl from California,” he explained. “I’m not looking. She’s the one I like. Logistically, it’s not working right now… but I’m not looking for anything else.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation airs on MTV Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>For the latest TV news and interviews subscribe to our new podcast ‘Watch With Us’ below!<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavoZ6jxm6z1Jqbmp%2Benruwv4yer2aflmKyrbXCnphmq5iurq%2B6jKyjmqWjYrWquYyapZ1lmpq%2FtLHYZqqhp6KafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
