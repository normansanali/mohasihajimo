The actress, 35, is shown with her deep auburn hair cropped into blunt bangs and with her arms covering her breasts, offering a slight peek at sideboob.</p><p>Bell was chosen as the star for the magazine’s Next Big Thing Issue, with Esquire posing the question of whether she is “the most important actor/director/writer of her generation.” Fans are sure to see more of the multi-hyphenate in the coming months as she is acting in three major films this year, including Million Dollar Arm with <strong><a href=#>Jon Hamm</a></strong>, <strong>Alan Arkin</strong>, and <strong>Bill Paxton</strong>. She also recently directed episodes of the Adult Swim show Childrens Hospital, and wrote the acclaimed 2013 comedy In a World…</p><p>The funny woman, who earned her first acting credit in 2002 at the age of 23, spoke to Esquire about wanting to become an actor from a young age. “I was tirelessly motivated, because I felt very clear about what I wanted to do,” <a href=#>she told the publication</a>. “I didn’t fully understand what it meant to be an actor, but I knew it was someone who gets to play different characters, gets to pretend to be in different worlds, and gets to make people laugh or feel. I’m sure there was some sort of validation, where the attention is on me and I can make people laugh; that’s normal kid stuff. But then it started to gestate into something more complicated and exciting and very fulfilling.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async width=467 height=375 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Lake Bell - Esquire" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>She also touched on Million Dollar Arm, which she called “sweet” and promised will make audience members cry, and spoke about her marriage to tattoo artist <strong>Scott Campbell</strong>. “Marriage is traditionally old-school in many respects,” she said. “It is highly antiquated, and, that being said, beautiful.”&nbsp;</p><p>This is hardly the first time Bell has shown some skin on the cover of a magazine. She went fully nude for <a href=#>New York Magazine‘s Fall Fashion issue</a> in 2013 with only a fake tattoo covering her most private bits.
