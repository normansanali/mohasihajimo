He has been speaking out about his divorce from Carly Waddell this past week.</p><p>While Evan kept quiet for about two years, he has revealed how hard the divorce has been for him and that he is still saddened by it.</p><p>As Evan has stated, he thinks he and Carly’s relationship didn’t work out because <a href=#>they didn’t have a proper foundation built</a>, but they have still done a good job co-parenting. Because, as Evan has said, <a href=#>it’s all about the kids at this point</a>.</p><p>Evan hasn’t been in the spotlight much since the split, but now he seems to be talking about the divorce and putting himself back out there, which is especially evident in his newest social media photo that fans can’t stop talking about.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Evan Bass’ comeback photo is nearly unrecognizable</h2><p>This past week, Evan has seemed to reappear in the headlines, and yesterday, his Instagram story photo shocked everyone.</p><p>As he took a selfie while taking a run in Boston, Bachelor Nation immediately noticed his muscular upper body in his thin tank top, which is a new look for him.</p><p>He also looked to be graying a bit on the sides of his hair, which made him look more distinguished, along with his shortened goatee.</p><p>On the @bachelor_dishes_the_dirt Instagram page, they took Evan’s photo and inserted a fire flame emoji, as well as a cloud raining in the top corner. They also captioned it, “Evan is back… that’s all I’m going to say… “ It was paired with a red rose and a sweating emoji.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Evan himself and others commented on his hot, new look</h2><p>Evan was the first to comment on the uploaded photo they took from his own story, as he simply put two kissing face emojis to show his love for the repost.</p><p>Another fan wrote, “@theebass Did you have a serious glow-up?? Like you were always fine but now you are Dayuuuuummmm fine. I know I’m not the only one seeing this??
