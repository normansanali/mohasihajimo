Her cousin <strong>Penelope Disick</strong>, 7, also participated in this Heaven and Hell theme in a dress that was half angel, half devil (complete with horns&nbsp;and&nbsp;a halo). The cousins’ friend was also dressed as an angel! <strong>Kourtney Kardashian,</strong> 40, shared a photo of the cute group costume to her Instagram on Oct. 31, writing, “👹 or 👼🏼.” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>You can see a photo of the costumes, here.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>It’s a surprise to see North rocking red lipstick again, since Kanye essentially banned his young daughter from makeup (well, according to <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>). North also wore red lips for the annual Kardashian Christmas Eve party in 2018, and used to rock a number of makeup looks on Kim’s social media accounts — up until recently.&nbsp;“I think [Kanye] had it, he changed all the rules,” Kim, 39, revealed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>&nbsp;at a dinner celebrating the launch of the KKW x WINNIE makeup collaboration in New York City on Sept. 12. Apparently, this even caused tension between Kim and Kanye!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I’d let her wear — you know, she has a little red for Christmas — I’d let her wear a red lip, or I’d let her do one pop of something. I’d let her, if she’s wearing a black dress, a black lip. So, I kind of got in trouble for that,” Kim confessed to E! News.&nbsp;“So, it’s now no more makeup.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The makeup ban was still being enforced when Kim caught up with the outlet for a follow-up interview in October. “North is trying to get in on the makeup but she’s being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager,” Kim revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>&nbsp;at an Ulta Beauty store, which is part of a chain of cosmetics retailers that just started selling KKW Beauty products. Kim still doesn’t exactly see eye-to-eye with Kanye over this matter, because she added, “It’s a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now, but it is what’s best.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5xe5JqZqenoqm1bsPErKtmnJWrtq150Z6bZqSZpcC1tcKkZKGZnKG8uLHEp2Scp6Opwq6xjGtnanFdpbWwwM5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
