Following his college career, he declared for the 2008 NBA draft and was selected as the third overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Mayo's early years in the NBA were marked by high-level scoring, making significant contributions to the teams he played for, particularly the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><h2 class=first:mt-0 data-mce-fragment=1 level=2>Setbacks and Bans</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Mayo's career took a turn when he faced off-the-court issues, including a suspension in 2011 for testing positive for a banned substance, which he attributed to an over-the-counter supplement. This suspension was followed by a ban from the NBA for failing the anti-drug program. Despite applying for reinstatement in 2016 and getting approved, Mayo did not find a team willing to take a chance on him. Subsequently, his eligibility for reinstatement in the NBA ended without any team signing him, effectively ending his career in the United States.</p><h2 class=first:mt-0 data-mce-fragment=1 level=2>Legacy and Current Status</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Unfortunately, Mayo's legacy in the NBA has been overshadowed by the longest suspension in league history.
