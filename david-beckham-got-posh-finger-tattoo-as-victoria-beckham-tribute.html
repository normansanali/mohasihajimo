The retired soccer star stepped out in Los Angeles on September 7 to honor pal <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a>’s new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In photos from the event, <a href=#>“Posh” is visible in a script font</a> on David’s middle finger.</p><p class=p1>David already has <a href=#>multiple tattoos dedicated to Victoria</a>, 49, whom he wed in 1999. He inked a portrait of the fashion designer on his left forearm in 2007, nearly seven years before he added <a href=#>her first name in cursive</a> on the same hand.</p><p class=p1>“The tattoos are a way of me expressing deeper feelings about the things I care about and love,” David told <i><a href=#>GQ</a> </i>in a March 2016 profile. “Am I done? Probably not. [I] think Victoria’s given up on telling me to stop now. She used to. She used to say, ‘Do you have to?’ But she knows it makes me happy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/David-Beckham-Proves-Hes-the-Spice-Girls-No-1-Fan-With-New-Posh-Tattoo-for-Wife-Victoria-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>David has more than 60 tattoos in total, including ones dedicated to each of his and Victoria’s four children: <a href=#>Brooklyn, 24, Romeo, 21, Cruz, 18, and Harper, 12</a>.</p><p class=p1>Now that David’s sons have grown up, they’ve also been <a href=#>keen to start their tattoo collections</a>. “There’s absolutely nothing that I can say,” David said during a June 2017 interview on <i><a href=#>The Late Late Show With James Corden</a>. </i>“[Brooklyn’s] got two. He was 18 pretty recently and he was counting the days down because he talked about having the tattoo for a long time.”</p><p class=p1>He added: “I always said, ‘Your first tattoo, if you’re going to have one, I wanna be there,’ just to experience it as a dad. So, that was the deal.” Brooklyn has developed an extensive collection in the years since his first tattoo shop visit.</p><p class=p1>David’s son Cruz is also tatted up and <a href=#>got a Spice Girls tattoo</a> earlier this year. The musician went to artist <a href=#><strong>Certified Lover Boy</strong></a> on September 3 to get a tattoo of the word “Posh” on his elbow.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While David and the boys have honored Victoria with <a href=#>permanent art</a>, she previously inked her husband’s initials on her wrist. Victoria ultimately lasered off the initials last year.</p><p class=p3><span class=s1>“You know I had these tattoos a long, long time ago and they just weren’t particularly delicate,” she said during an <a href=#>October 2022 appearance on <i>Today with Hoda & Jenna</i></a>, explaining her decision. “Mine were just a little bit thick and bleeding and just not looking as pretty. I was just a bit sick of the tattoo, it’s as simple as that.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5mut7XDZpmem5udrq55xqirZqifqLVussinnp6qXamutcDOqGSaq12rtqTAzqugmmWSmrCstMCmZK2qmZfCtbGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
