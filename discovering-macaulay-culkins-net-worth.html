Max gained fame as a child actor, notably for his role as Kevin McCallister in the movies “Home Alone” and “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York”. His popularity surged as he appeared in other movies like “The Good Son”, “Saved!”, “Sex and Breakfast”, “Party Monster” and “Getting Even with Dad”, significantly contributing to his net worth.</p><p>Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980, in Manhattan, New York. His prominence skyrocketed during his youth as he earned over $1,000,000 per movie between 1990 and 1995. His brothers, Rory Culkin and Kieran Culkin are also actors in show business. However, they have not achieved the same level of success as Macauley. Despite a decline in popularity as an adult, Culkin remains a highly regarded former child star in the United States.</p><p>Evidence of Culkin’s net worth is showcased through his purchase of a Manhattan apartment valued at over $2 million. The spacious home, spanning over 5,200 square feet, boasts three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a living room, and a small office. The walls are adorned with Macauley’s art, including a painting of Kurt Cobain. Culkin also owns a striking matte black Lexus SC430 which features an exceptional audio stereo system.</p><p>Culkin’s association with Michael Jackson, especially his appearance in Jackson‘s video “Black or White”, contributed to his increased net worth. Though he was rumored to have been a guest in Jackson’s bedroom, Culkin denied any case of sexual molestation.</p><p>Currently, Culkin is continuing his acting career and is romantically involved with Jordan Lane Price, a former actress of the movie “All My Children”.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Salary</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Macaulay Culkin</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$15 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 26, 1980</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Voice Actor, Child Actor, Musician</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Professional Children’s School, School of American Ballet</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Rachel Miner (m. 1998–2002)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Kit Culkin, Patricia Brentrup</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Kieran Culkin, Rory Culkin, Quinn Culkin, Christian Culkin, Jennifer Adamson, Shane Culkin, Dakota Culkin</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Jordan Lane Price, Jordan Lane Price</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Macaulay Carson Culkin , Mac , Macauley Culkin</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000346</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss, Funniest Actor In A Motion Picture (Leading Role), Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>The Pizza Underground</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, MTV Movie Award for Best Villain, MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo, Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite Movie Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“Home Alone”, “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York”, “Getting Even with Dad Dalary”, “Richie Rich”, “The Good Son”, “Saved!”, “Sex and Breakast”, “Party Monster” and “Getting Even with Dad”</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Black or White”,</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=trademarks><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Rosy lips, blue eyes and pale skin</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Innocent, angelical face</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiboquTpMOmvsinnmalkZiutrjAsmScrZygtq%2B%2FjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
