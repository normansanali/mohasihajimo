Tamerlane Usher, despite her questionable actions and lack of sympathy from her family, faces her own demons as she tries to launch her wellness subscription service, Goldbug. Sleep-deprived and abandoned by her husband, she experiences blackouts and encounters figures that may or may not be real. During her launch, she catches glimpses of a woman named Candy, who is revealed to be another one of Verna's disguises. As the slideshow intended to promote Goldbug starts displaying images of Candy instead of Tamerlane, chaos ensues, and Tamerlane's aunt Madeline chases after Verna, who disappears in a puff of smoke. The question arises: is Candy really someone posing as Tamerlane, or is she a projection of Tamerlane herself? As Tamerlane smashes mirrors and sees Candy's reflection instead of her own, the uncertainty lingers. Despite the existence of Verna, who has been tearing the Usher family apart, it remains unclear if Candy is truly present or if her purpose has already been fulfilled.Meanwhile, Frederick, the father of the family, continues to torment his wife Morelle, who he suspects of infidelity. He feeds her a paralyzing medicine to keep her from getting better and relentlessly questions her about an affair with Prospero. Frederick's growing paranoia and refusal to acknowledge the reality of his siblings' tragic fates indicate his own descent into madness. With Tamerlane's death, he believes that being a full Usher no longer offers any protection.The episode also focuses on Pym's investigation into Verna's true identity. He uncovers documentation connecting her to the deaths of various Usher family members and tracks down potential leads, but they all turn out to be dead ends. Roderick, despite witnessing Victorine's suicide, refuses to believe Pym's findings, dismissing them as forgeries and choosing to embrace his own hallucinations instead.Overall, "Goldbug" sets the stage for the impending demise of Frederick and the inevitable confrontation between Madeline, Roderick, and Verna. Madness permeates the storylines of the Usher family members, blurring the lines between reality and hallucination, leaving the audience questioning the true nature of the characters' experiences. Whether Tamerlane really saw Candy in the audience during her launch remains a mystery, as the episode doesn't provide a definitive answer. The ambiguity contributes to the ongoing theme of madness and the characters' struggles with their own sanity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufony1tMRmnZqknGK8p3nToZxmoJ%2BqwKZ5zp9krquYmr9wwMeeZJ%2BZnKF6sLKMrZ%2BeZZikwrSxjKidZq2jnbKzecOim2askaKys7jAp5xmqpWWua3FjKycnmWTlrulxYyipWasmJp6osHDopynm5Visba%2ByKeeZqCVp3qtrdSnmqE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
