Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.</p><p>WILDWOOD, Mo.– Nelly’s abandoned Wildwood mansion should have some a new owner soon. The nearly 11,000 sq foot home on Hidden Valley Drive is now listed as <a href=#>pending on realtor.com</a>.</p><p>Keller Williams Realty STL says the closing date is expected to happen in the next few weeks. The real estate company said the house sold within days of going on the market in February but took longer to close because it was a short sale.</p><p>Bankrate.com says a short sale is when the lender agrees to accept a mortgage payoff amount less than what is owed in order to facilitate a sale of the property by a financially distressed owner.&nbsp;</p><p>The home was listed for $599,000 and was called an “amazing investment opportunity.” Nelly bought the house in 2002 and it was listed for $2.5 million at the time.</p><p>“With hundreds of showings and dozens of offers, this home garnered more attention than any other St. Louis home to date,” said Patricia Shannon, the listing agent.</p><p>Shannon said it received 52 offers. Nelly’s publicist says the house sold for over the asking price.</p><p>“My team and I had multiple marketing strategies to get the maximum amount of exposure and create the highest amount of demand. In turn, this leads to the highest price and best offers for all of our properties at every price point- and we certainly priced this unique luxury property in order to gain national attention,” said Shannon.</p><p>It’s unclear what is the negotiated price but the new owner will likely have to spend thousands of dollars before anyone can live in the home.</p><p>The listing pictures show things are in disrepair. There are floors that need to be put down, plumbing is needed in a bathroom, and the pool needs to be fixed up.</p><p>Nelly, originally from St. Louis, apparently planned to buy the place and then flip it with a “contractor friend,” TMZ&nbsp;<a href=#>noted</a>. Those plans do not appear to have worked out.</p><p>The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom house was&nbsp;burglarized in 2009.&nbsp;It’s uncertain what exactly was stolen. <a href=#>Here is home surveillance of the break-in</a>. You can also find a <a href=#>photo gallery </a>of the surveillance and police on the scene.</p><p>The home was built in 1998 and is about 30 minutes outside of Downtown St. Louis. It is close to the Hidden Valley Ski Resort in Eureka.</p><p>You can see the entire listing along with the photos of the home on <a href=#>realtor.com</a>.
