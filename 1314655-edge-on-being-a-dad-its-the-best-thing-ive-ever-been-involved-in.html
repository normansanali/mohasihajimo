When asked about becoming a father during his time away from WWE, “The Rated R-Superstar” stated that it’s the best thing he’s ever been involved in.</p><p>“It’s the best thing I’ve ever been involved in,” said Edge. “Absolutely, bar none. Nothing comes close,” Edge said. “And I’ve had I say this, and it kind of sounds egotistical. I love my life. I have an awesome life. It’s everything that I’ve ever wanted, and there was work to get there.</p><p>“And there was a lot of trials and tribulations, but they added to the story they added to the past, to the point where they’re also just the way things worked out like Beth and I started having kids after I retired the first time, so I was 40 when we started having kids, and I was in a much better place from an emotional standpoint, from a maturity standpoint. I’m never going to be mature, let’s face it. But more mature. So it was the right time; it was the right pocket. It was the right time for her. It all coincided that we could be here and be present.”</p><p>He went on to describe how, given that he never met his own dad, he learned about parenting as he went. He then noted that it has changed his mindset about wrestling because he has an “added layer of anxiety.”</p><p>“I’ve never met my dad. I’ve never seen a picture, so I was trying to figure this thing out as I went, and that’s when I finally just decided like, I just got to be here for them and remind them I loved them and hold them and snuggle them and then throw them in the pool,” said Edge. “And so it is absolutely the best thing I’ve ever been involved in what it has added though, in terms of wrestling. When I wrestled last time, I didn’t have kids. And there’s a level added layer of anxiety that I didn’t have before. I never thought about being in the ring before; I just did it. Now there’s an extra layer of nerves that wasn’t there before, and it’s kind of strange, and I kind of don’t like it. But I think that’s why.”</p><p>Edge is set to face Damian Priest in a high-profile match on the August 22 edition of WWE RAW, which will be held in Toronto.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>Kurt Angle Reveals Hilarious Rib That Vince McMahon Pulled On Edge Ahead Of Hair vs. Hair Match At Judgment Day 2002</a></p><p>What do you make of Edge’s comments?
