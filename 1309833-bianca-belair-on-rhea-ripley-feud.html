I feel like Rhea Ripley and I are both at the forefront of a new generation of women in WWE. To see us go head to head and see who comes out on top is something everyone is looking forward to. It was a little discouraging and frustrating that we weren’t able to have that happen. But in the end, I feel like it’s even more build-up for when it finally is gonna happen. I’ve always seen that match as a WrestleMania type of match as well.”</p><p>Belair also said that her feud with Ripley has the potential to last several years because they have youth on their side, and there’s a clear contrast that separates them now as well.</p><p>“I definitely think this is going to last years and years and years. We didn’t just start on Raw and SmackDown at the same time. This goes all the way back to NXT when we first got into NXT. Us being the final two in the Royal Rumble [two years ago] and then both winning titles at WrestleMania the same exact year, we have both been on opposite sides doing equally amazing things.</p><p>“Right now, it’s clearly a distinction with Rhea Ripley and this change of attitude and her joining The Judgment Day and her kind of on the darker side of things, it’s really a distinction between the two of us — one on the side of good and the other evil. I think it adds more to the feud. It’s a big contrast there.”</p><p>SummerSlam will see Bianca Belair defend her RAW Women’s Championship against Becky Lynch, while Ripley will lead<br>The Judgment Day’s Damian Priest and Finn Bálor into battle against The Mysterios in a no disqualification tag match.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJpcHFrY2Kvqq3NnJhmmpWhrqq%2BjKilZqqYmq5uvsipo56xXZuytrA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
