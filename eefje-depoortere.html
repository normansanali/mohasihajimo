She rose to prominence after winning the 2009 Aardbeienprinses van Beervelde pageant and finishing third in the 2011 Miss Style Belgium pageant.</p><p>Furthermore, Sjokz was named “Best Esports Host” at The Game Awards in 2018.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Eefje_Depoortere_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Eefje Depoortere? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Sjokz’s net worth is believed to be <strong>$1 million</strong> as a result of her hosting profession. Although her specific earnings are unknown, League of Legends players can make up to $15,000 per year. This does not include the award money. A league legend champion can earn up to $25,000 to $35,000 depending on the sponsors and events category. Top players like Lilchiipmunk, Emmahdorable, and xChocobars earn around $300,000 each year.</p><p>Skojz, likewise, must earn between €52,188 and €91,801 as a reporter, which is also the average income for a Belgian reporter. Sjokz currently leads a luxury lifestyle, as evidenced by her Instagram photos. Her Instagram is full of her artwork or photos of her partying and traveling with her friends.</p><h2><span id=Eefje_Depoortere-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Eefje Depoortere- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Sjokz was born on June 16, 1987, in Sint-Andries, Bruges, Belgium. She spent most of her childhood in the Belgian province of Sint-Andres, known as the city of little castles. She studied history and journalism at Ghent University and graduated with honors. Furthermore, she obtained a Master of Education degree despite having no idea what she was doing with her life.</p><p>Nonetheless, she developed an early interest in gaming and spent hours playing it. Tomb Raider 3 was her first game. She first wanted to be a sportswriter after graduating from college since she enjoyed football and tennis. She altered her mind after seeing the trend of writing articles on computer gaming and decided to write about the league instead. Because poker was a prominent game during her university years, she decided to write about League rather than traditional sports.</p><h2><span id=Eefje_Depoortere-_Relationship_Boyfriend>Eefje Depoortere- Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Sjokz is most likely single as of 2020, as there are no reports of her being in a relationship. Furthermore, her social media handler does not reveal anyone who may be related to the journalist. Unlike many other ladies who use their Instagram accounts to demonstrate their belonging and relationships, her account is loaded with images of her works. Furthermore, she is largely active on Twitter, and there is no evidence of her partner there. There is little question that the stunning Belgian will finally find the perfect match due to her talent and stunning appearance.</p><p>Furthermore, Sjokz is friends with X Peke, a Spanish player that competes in the European League of Legends Championship Series. Most of their admirers adore their captivating chemistry. Beyond the European gaming scores, Sjokz and xPeke have an unbreakable relationship. However, neither couple has publicly confronted their relationship. It’s possible she understands the importance of keeping her personal life out of the spotlight. Sjokz also frequently teases her admirers on Twitter. In her own words, the Belgian beauty once tweeted:</p><p>“I doubt my boyfriend would agree, but I enjoy the pancakes.”</p><p>Despite this, there is no mention of anyone who could be her boyfriend. As a result, she may be single for the time being.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Tom Stenberg</a>, <a href=#>Cyrus Michael Christopher Dancy</a>, and <a href=#>Morgane Stapleton</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>host</a> <a href=# rel=tag>reporter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Shirleen Allicot</a></h3>Shirleen Allicot- Biography Shirleen Allicot is a co-host of Eyewitness News This Morning and Eyewitness News at Noon in the United States.
