He gained fame as a performer for his portrayal of Tommy Oliver in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and other Power Rangers television series.</p><h2>Who is Jason David Frank’s brother?</h2><p>Eric Frank was the late actor Jason David Frank’s real-life older brother. Erik passed away on April 16, 2001, at the age of 29.</p><p>Frank was cast as Tommy Oliver, the Green Ranger. The role would last 14 episodes. Because of his popularity, he was reintroduced as the White Ranger and the team’s new leader. Frank was supposed to play Adam Steele in VR Troopers (originally titled “Cybertron”), and he shot a pilot episode before being called back to Power Rangers. According to both Frank and Brad Hawkins, Hawkins’ character was originally intended to replace Tommy Oliver as the White Ranger on Power Rangers.</p><p>However, due to Tommy Oliver’s popularity among Ranger fans, Frank was reintroduced, with Tommy Oliver taking on the role of White Ranger. Hawkins would take over as commander of VR Troopers. Ryan Steele replaced Adam Steele as the main character. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers became Power Rangers Zeo after three seasons. The transition is part of the annual Ranger suit change to correspond with the Super Sentai series’ annual change. Frank’s character evolved into the Red Zeo Ranger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqKRqLyvecOaraKcXZu%2ForrKrGSbqp%2Bptaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
