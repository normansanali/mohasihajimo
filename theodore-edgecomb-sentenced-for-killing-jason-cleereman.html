She testified that she followed her husband in the car once he stepped out of the vehicle because she wanted to be with him. She said she saw that the bicyclist had a gun, and she shouted that to her husband, but he did not hear her. Watching Edgecomb’s eyes, she knew he was going to shoot her husband, she said.</p><p>“I could just feel it,” she said.</p><p>And that’s what happened.</p><p>At sentencing, Edgecomb repeated his claim at trial that he acted in self-defense and that Cleereman’s car hit him.</p><p>“I never intended to kill Mr. Cleereman, but I have realized I have killed another human being, and that weighs heavily on me to this day and will continue to for the rest of my life,” he said in a statement read by his attorney.</p><p><a href=#>This is how he described the actual shooting back at trial</a>.</p><p>“I took a step back,” he said, “and as I step back, it was the reaction from that, the firearm just went off.”</p><p>Edgecomb, who is Black, continued to maintain at sentencing that Cleereman, who is white, called him the n-word.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>“I never intended to kill Mr. Cleereman”: During his sentencing on Friday, the defense read a statement from Theodore Edgecomb to the court. <a href=#>@LawCrimeNetwork</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AAU7gh88Q1</a></p><p>— Law&Crime Network (@LawCrimeNetwork) <a href=#>April 8, 2022</a></p><p>The late attorney’s loved ones have repeatedly rubbished the slur allegation, maintaining that he worked with people of different backgrounds and loved learning about their cultures.</p><p>Evanjelina denied at trial that her husband used the n-word.

It is part of my daily life. I didn’t get a phone call that told me that my husband was killed. I saw it myself. I will forever have the images in my head. They will be ingrained in my memory and they will be replayed in my head over and over for the rest of my life.”</p><p>[Screenshot via WISN]</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=a3d7cad3d0e3cfc2d4c2cdc7c0d1cacec68dc0ccce>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6m1prvDqKmeZZWZtKavzqaZZquVo8GmusKem2aen6d6rLXLpaCnn12frrS7zWaapZ2Vp7Kurc1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
