On top of that, there has also been a lot of discussion about Levine’s personal life including <a href=#>a love triangle he was a part of</a>.Unfortunately for Adam Levine and his family, in 2022 an Instagram model named Sumner Stroh came forward and accused him of carrying on an affair with her. Now that Stroh is in the headlines, it begs an obvious question, will she cash in on being at the center of a major scandal?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-levine-and-sumner-stroh-rsquo-s-cheating-scandal>Adam Levine And Sumner Stroh’s Cheating Scandal</h2><p>After Adam Levine became famous, the Maroon 5 frontman met a Victoria’s Secret model named Behati Prinsloo in 2012.

On top of that, Levine often spoke about how much he adored his wife and she played a major role in Maroon 5’s music video for their song “Girls Like You”.</p><p>In 2022, Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo’s relationship wound up in the spotlight for a really sad reason. In September, a 23-year-old Instagram and TikTok model named Sumner Stroh uploaded a video to the latter social media network <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming she had an affair with Levine</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of claiming that she carried on an affair with Adam Levine for “about a year”, Sumner Stroh also shared images of private messages she received from the Maroon 5 singer.</p><p>While speaking about the alleged affair she had with Adam Levine, Sumner Stroh said tried to explain she was immature when she got involved with him. “At the time, you know, I was young, I was naïve, and, I mean, quite frankly, I feel exploited.”</p><p>After news of Sumner Stroh’s claims went public, Adam Levine publically denied having an affair with her only hours later. However, Levine did state that he shared inappropriate texts with Stroh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in ANY kind of flirtatious manner. I did not have an affair, nevertheless, I crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life. In certain instances it became inappropriate. I have addressed that and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family.”</p><p>“My wife and my family is all I care about in this world. To be this naive and stupid enough to risk the only thing that truly matters to me was the greatest mistake I could ever make. I will never make it again. I take full responsibility. We will get through it and we will get through it together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stroh has countered his response, claiming that he should get a "dictionary".</p><h2 id=will-sumner-stroh-cash-in-on-the-adam-levine-affair-scandal>Will Sumner Stroh Cash In On The Adam Levine Affair Scandal?</h2><p>Anytime a mostly unknown person comes forward to accuse a famous person of something, a lot of people begin wondering aloud if their motivation is money.</p><p>Of course, Sumner Stroh is the only person who can truly know what her motivation is for speaking publically about Adam Levine.
