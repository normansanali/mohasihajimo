The show’s first two seasons were hugely popular among fans, earning a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">collective Tomatometer score</a> of 84 percent and a passionate fanbase. Many of those same fans were also among the viewer bases for other discarded Netflix series like Warrior Nun and Lockwood & Co., and they’re <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sensing a trend in the trail of broken hearts</a> the streamer has left in its wake.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Back in the day, Netflix was broadly seen as the savior our canceled favorites needed. It was often the only streamer to put its faith in canceled properties, and its charity saw a number of shows — including Arrested Development, Longmire, and You — maintain for several seasons after they were first canceled. That status as a haven for lost shows is a thing of the past, however, and increasingly Netflix is earning a reputation as the place where fantasy shows go to die.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>Thankfully, Netflix was never the only streamer to put faith in the shows ditched by the competition. Other options like Hulu and Prime are also known to save canceled shows, which could provide hope for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">masses of burned Shadow and Bone fans</a>.</p><h2 id=h-could-shadow-and-bone-have-a-future-on-another-streamer data-injectable=false>Could Shadow and Bone have a future on another streamer?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shadow-and-bone-4.jpg><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>In 2022, Netflix made the terrible decision to cancel Warrior Nun. Fans of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highly-reviewed series</a> were gobsmacked by the decision, particularly in the wake of a broadly-popular second season. They fought, and fought hard, for any kind of renewal of the show, and a good nine months <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after it was canceled, they won</a>. Warrior Nun got the green light for a trilogy of films, rather than a fresh season, but its coming back. That’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what matters most</a>.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>The success of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Warrior Nun fanbase could inform the fight</a> in store for Shadow and Bone fans. The show’s base kept up the rallying cry for months, marching, erecting billboards, and sharing near-constant hashtags to keep the movement alive. Without that kind of momentum, Shadow and Bone has little chance of succeeding, but a concentrated effort truly could see the show return.</p><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=964 data-injectable=true>Even if Shadow and Bone doesn’t return, a passionate fan campaign could at least see the Six of Crows spin-off get the go ahead. The book behind the story is among Bardugo’s best, and her fans have been waiting to see the thrilling heist make the transition to live-action for years. It’s easily among her most popular stories — and contains her most popular characters — so the story is all but assured to succeed. It <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">could even be better, in its return</a>, if it lands on a streamer that will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stay true to the source material</a>, instead of Netflixing it up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shadow-and-Bone_Crows.jpg><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>The streamers most likely to pick up a Grishaverse continuation, based on history, are Hulu and Prime. Both streamers are, like Netflix, known for putting their faith in canceled properties, and that faith has seen shows like The Expanse and The Mindy Project return for sometimes seasons on end.</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>In a surprising turn of events, however, history shows that the same network or streamer to cancel a series is the most likely to eventually save it. A good quarter of canceled shows, historically, were saved by the same network that gave them the ax, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to TVLine.com</a>, and we could see Shadow and Bone join that trend. It’s not likely — if Netflix didn’t save Warrior Nun after all the embarrassment the fanbase put it through, why would it save Shadow and Bone? — but its possible.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>What’s more likely, however, is that the fanbase convinces either an alternate streamer or moviemaker to put their faith in Leigh Bardugo’s world. With enough concentrated effort from the fanbase, history has shown this to be entirely do-able, so long as our passion for a revival doesn’t ebb with time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ytn56qlWKubrLUrayrnV2bvLN50qGYnaenYq6vsIybpqedXaS7bq3NqKuhnaJiwLW%2BxJqknqpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
