On top of that, Aspects can push your equipment even further, making your build as strong as it can get. If you are looking for a particular Aspect or Unique but can’t seem to find it — there’s a tool to increase your chances. Here is how you can target Aspects and Uniques in Diablo 4.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Target Uniques in Diablo 4</h2><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>The easiest way to target Uniques in <a href=#>Diablo 4</a> is by using the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4 Target Farming tool</a>. <strong>Each enemy in Diablo 4 has its own drop rate</strong> of dropping armor pieces for specific body parts, and this tool walks you through that fact. For example, if you are trying to target the <a href=#>Penitent Greaves</a> — which are boots — the drowned enemy type has the highest chance of dropping boots, therefore, the highest chance of dropping Pentinent Greaves.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>The Farming Tool also helps you decide <strong>which dungeon and location to farm</strong> depending on the unique you’re looking to acquire. Similar to the drop rates with enemies, locations also have their own drop rate for Unique armor pieces and weapons!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Use Diablo 4 Farming Tool</h3><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>The Diablo 4 Farming Tool is the best way to target Uniques currently, and we will walk you through how to use it effectively.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>First, you want to select the class you’re playing as and then which Unique you would like to target. After choosing the unique, the<strong> filter will show you the enemy types with the highest chance of dropping the Unique</strong> — where the more green plus signs mean the highest opportunity. On the right-hand side, it will also let you know <strong>which locations have a “high density” for the Unique.</strong></p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>I love this tool because it allows me to select more than one Unique at a time. The feature to choose more than one at a time has led me to complete my build at a faster rate, where each armor piece is now a Unique!</p><p data-characters=53 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>The Best Legendary Farming Spots in Diablo 4</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How to Target Aspects in Diablo 4</h3><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Targeting Aspects is a different story but follows the same process. Each Aspect is only allowed on specific armor parts, so you will want to target that armor type. For example, say you want to target the <a href=#>Edgemasters Aspect</a> — an offensive Aspect. You would select as many offensive items in the Diablo 4 Farming Tool to increase your chances of getting a weapon that contains that Aspect.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Once you find the Aspect you’re looking for, you can <strong>extract the Aspect at the Occultist</strong>. Then, move the extracted Aspect to your desired weapon or armor piece. This feature is my favorite part of the game since it allows for remarkable customization.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=false>Another way to target Aspects (not all) is to <strong>hover your cursor over a dungeon</strong>, and the game will tell you which Aspect will be rewarded to you upon completion.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
