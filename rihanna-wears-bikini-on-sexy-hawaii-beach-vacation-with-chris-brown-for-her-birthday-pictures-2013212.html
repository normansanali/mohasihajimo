Celebrating her 25th birthday on Wednesday, Feb. 20, the “Stay” singer was on the beach in Hawaii with her boyfriend Brown, 23, where the couple were photographed holding hands during an oceanside stroll and then snuggling by the surf. (Also quite noticeable: In one photo, Rihanna holds what appears to be two blunts.)</p><p>The songstress gave a sneak peak of her world-famous booty, wearing pink bikini bottoms, concealed only slightly by a mesh cover-up skirt, plus a black tank-top covering up her bikini top. “#epic day already, I woke up to sunshine in paradise and #STAY done jumped 54 spots to #3 on the BillboardHot100!!” she <a href=# rel=noopener>tweeted</a> to her 28 million followers. “Walked up into #2013 like I owned a ho.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/rihanna-chris-brown-lg-02.jpg><p>In an amateur shot apparently taken inside a limo, Rihanna sits on Brown’s lap in a bikini top and skirt, grinning mischievously in sunglasses and giant hoop <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> as her man, also in shades, looks off in the distance. “#Pour it up pour it up! #birthdaybehavior,” she wrote beneath the Instagram pic.

Both partying at Playhouse in Hollywood on Feb 15, the controversial couple didn’t seem to be “<a href=# rel=noopener>on speaking terms</a>,” according to an observer. “She refused to sit with or even near him,” the witness explained of the twosome. “When she noticed he was there, she made a huge show of rubbing her presence in his face.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/rihanna-chris-brown-lg-03.jpg><p>One potential reason for Rihanna’s anger: Brown attended another bash on Wednesday evening with another woman — his ex, <a href=# rel=noopener>Karrueche Tran.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaroZiWu6%2BtjLCcmqqjYq%2Bqt8inoGannmLApsTYZp%2Bar5Getm6uxJqaoWWmlrCiwMiopWavmam1bq%2FHq6CsZZKnvLi6jJ%2Bmq2WYmr9ursirq6Gcka56sbXCrayrnaNif3F9kmtoa2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
