(Just asking, when’s the last time anybody heard from The X Factor‘s season two champ, <b>Tate Stevens</b>?)</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The auditions took a brief break from Denver, and when they returned, things got super-awkward. Three sisters, who make up the group <strong>Roxxy Montana</strong>, took the stage and one girl was <i>clearly&nbsp;</i>better than her sisters. Fortunately, the got another shot with a church song and blended beautifully. (How awkward was it when&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kelly Rowland</a>&nbsp;</strong>was like, “Obviously, there’s always a lead singer.”&nbsp;<strong>Beyoncé</strong>, anyone?)</p><h3>Long Island Auditions: Bad Boys Vs. Nice Guys</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>The next stop was Long Island, which brought us 29-year-old bartender&nbsp;<strong>Rachel Potter</strong>. I’m not sure why the judges kept bringing up her age — seriously, you’d think she had one foot in the friggin’ grave the way they talked about her — but I’m really glad she blew them away with her kick-ass country rendition of&nbsp;<strong>Queen</strong>‘s “Somebody To Love.” Forget Riley Brown; Rachel is&nbsp;my&nbsp;“one to watch.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Then came 22-year-old ice cream truck driver<strong> Jorge Pena</strong>, who gave a very sultry performance of a Spanish song I wasn’t familiar with — which is weird, because I took Spanish for nine years growing up. He was a huge womanizer and everyone hated him for it, but they let him through for some reason. I don’t predict he’ll be around much longer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Long Island’s own&nbsp;<strong>Simone Torres</strong>, 19, then served up a weird-ish rendition of&nbsp;<strong>Mack Rice</strong>‘s “Mustang Sally.” I honestly couldn’t tell if she did a good job or not, but the judges seemed to like her enough to put her through. In fact, they&nbsp;loved&nbsp;her. Simon even told her she had the best audition they’d seen thus far, which I thought was a bit of an over-sell. But hey, I’m not on the panel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>After a brief trip back to Denver, we were introduced to 19-year-old<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Al Calderon</strong></a>, the designated “Happy Birthday” singer and host at a restaurant on Long Island. With his “gorgeous” eyes — so sayeth Ms. Rowland — and smooth vocals, Al quickly won over the judges. But more importantly, he had the audience screaming. I don’t know what “it” is, but this kid has “it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The final “yes” of the second premiere night went to 41-year-old&nbsp;<strong>Denise Weeks</strong>, who blew the judges away with her performance of&nbsp;<strong>Whitney Houston</strong>‘s “The Greatest Love Of All.” Looks like she won’t be singing on New York City subways any more!<br></p><h3>WATCH: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">X Factor Auditions Night 2 Recap</a><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></h3><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async alt="Subscribe to me on YouTube" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hl-yt-subscribe.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>— Andy Swift</strong><br><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @AndySwift</a></p><h3>More ‘X Factor’ Season 3:</h3><li>Alex & Sierra Flaunt ‘Toxic’ Love On ‘X Factor’ Season Premiere — Watch</li><li>‘X Factor’ Judges ‘Blown Away’ By Rion Paige, 13, On Season Premiere</li><li>‘The X Factor’ Season Premiere: Sexy Grandma Lillie McCloud Stuns Judges</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH16e5BrZrFllpawtbvRZpilZZOWuaWx0ailZpmlmba1tc6nZK%2BhlJq8br%2FEqauepZKav259kWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
