In a recent video for his channel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Film Theorists</a>, Mat Pat has started a campaign to become the new host. He’s started <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Change.org petition</a> that has already gotten over 7,000 signatures.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>In his latest video, he outlined why choosing a new and younger host would be good for the show as a strategy to draw in new audiences and to make sure the information presented on the show remained relevant going forward. He also discussed how YouTubers are used to working in the kind of environments for quickly filmed low-budget shows just like Jeopardy!.</p><p>“Duh, of course I would love to host Jeopardy!. It is literally in the title of this video. I would like to nominate myself for the role. I think I’d be great… You get 0% of the jobs you don’t apply for, so here I am! I have four YouTube channels that have threaded the needle of information and entertainment for ten years.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>After he called for fans to Tweet at the official Jeopardy! account, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#whoismatpat began to trend on Twitter</a> with many fans championing him as the new host for the show. He also suggested YouTubers like Derik Miller from Vertitasium, Diana Cowern, and Michael Stevens, Kevin Lieber, or Jake Roper of VSauce fame as potential hosts. While fans are fighting for Mat Pat, these may be better choices for several reasons.</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>In his video, he mentioned how Mayim Bialik is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">currently under fire for her previous comments</a> but failed to mention he has been mired in controversy in the past as well. He butted heads with Undertale creator Tody Fox and Pirate Software after breaking YouTube’s rules about tagging content and using false promotional strategies while playing the game Heartbound. He has also been accused of falsely using the suicide of famous YouTuber Etika as a way to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">push a narrative on cancel culture</a> that had nothing to do with his death.</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>On top of this, he has shared a lot of controversial statements within his own videos. He used transphobic language like “shemale” in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> about Team Fortress 2‘s Pyro that also included bigoted pseudoscience about gay men. He also made a video where he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made several transphobic “attack helicopter” jokes</a> that while he has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">since apologized for</a>, still rubbed many fans the wrong way. He also made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a video</a> justifying the use of black face in the Pokemon Jynx’s design.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>On top of all of this, he has also been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of plagiarism</a> in the past as well as stealing fan art for his videos without the artist’s permission. In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there is an entire blog</a> dedicated to keeping receipts on Mat Pat’s previous controversial actions. Needless to say, the YouTuber has a lot going against him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey <a href=#>@MatPatGT</a> I'm pretty disappointed here and so is our community.
