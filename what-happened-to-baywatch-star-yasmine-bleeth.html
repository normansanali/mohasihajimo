Unfortunately, her alcohol and cocaine dependence led to her unceremonious exit from the world of fame leading to the inevitable question, “Where is Yasmine Bleeth now?”</p><h2 id=h-how-did-she-begin-her-journey data-injectable=false>How did she begin her journey?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Early-Yasmine-Bleeth.jpg><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>As a pre-teen New York native, Yasmeen Bleeth made her debut appearance and began her acting journey portraying the 12-year-old orphan Theresa in the 1983 film Hey Babe alongside the legendary comedian Buddy Hackett. Bleeth’s portrayal of a subjugated orphan striving to achieve her dream of becoming a performing artist amidst a whirlpool of obstructions earned her much-desired recognition.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>A few years later, at the age of 16, Bleeth starred in the daytime soap opera Ryan’s Hope, which was canceled in 1989.&nbsp;Months following her mother’s death, she resumed her acting career by playing LeeAnn Demerest in One Life to Live. Bleeth had also received the opportunity to star in the soap opera Herman’s Head before landing her breakthrough appearance in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baywatch</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bleeth on Baywatch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Yasmine-Bleeth-Baywatch-1.jpg><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Bleeth’s success received a huge boost after being cast as Caroline Holden in Baywatch from 1993 to 1997. She played the younger sister of Stephanie Holden and her character was supposed to appear for just one episode. However, her immense popularity made the producers hire her for more screen time and cast her in a total of 72 episodes.</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>In the show, she starred opposite the central characters and stars like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Hasselhoff</a> and other female co-stars like Alexandra Paul, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pamela Anderson</a>, and Carmen Electra, who went on to receive subsequent recognition and fame for their works. Her character was romantically involved with Logan Fowler, played by Australian actor Jaason Simmons.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Bleeth was able to become a household name that even found a perfect representation in the cult hit sitcom <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends</a>, where the characters Joey and Chandler’s love for the show was synonymous with their obsession with Yasmine Bleeth.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>This tremendous popularity earned her innumerable accolades and brought her widespread attention, as her name was put on People’s 50 Most Beautiful People list in 1995. Bleeth also managed to occupy a place on FHM’s 100 Sexiest Women in the World list from 1996 to 2001.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Post-Baywatch and drug abuse</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Yasmine-Bleeth-Drugs.jpg><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Bleeth’s exit from Baywatch saw the downfall of her popularity, caused by her constant battle with drug abuse, specifically cocaine addiction. The actress appeared in a few projects and TV shows like Nash Bridges opposite Don Johnson and Cheech Marin for three years. She also went on to star in movies like BASEketball, Coming Soon, Undercover Angel, and&nbsp;Goodbye, Casanova.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>Her departure from Baywatch was blamed on her heavy dependence on drugs which made her difficult to work with. This was confirmed by the producer of the show, Douglas Schwartz, who stated that Bleeth frequently arrived late on the set and was also going through a rough patch in her personal life, which accelerated the continuing troubles on the part of the crew members to deal with her indiscretion.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>The Baywatch star opened up about her troubled years as an addict which were simultaneous with the on-and-off relationship with Richard Grieco, exacerbating her degree of dependency. The actress, in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a>, did not hesitate to share the secret details of her past scandalous life. “I never expected to get into drugs,” she said.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Like is the case for many addicts, her drug usage started as a social thing, something her fame could certainly have given her easy access to, but it quickly developed into something out of her control. She also said that she had cocaine delivered to her home <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“like ordering Chinese food.”</a></p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>As a result, she suffered from severe weight loss, sporadically encountered bloody noses, and collapsed at a Glamour photoshoot. Following the incident, she checked into a rehab facility in Malibu but she went back to cocaine within two weeks.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>A silver lining is that, during her time in rehab, Bleeth met her future husband – who she’s now been married to for many years – Paul Cerrito, a club owner in Michigan. Paul was reportedly assisting her in struggling with her addiction problems and the two married in 2002. In an interview, Yasmine Bleeth candidly told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour</a>, “Consciously trying to stay off drugs is now part of my life and always will be.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where is she now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bleeth-now.jpg><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Bleeth appeared in Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding in 2003.
