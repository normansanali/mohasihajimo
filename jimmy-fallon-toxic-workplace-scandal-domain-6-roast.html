As one employee told&nbsp;Rolling Stone, "It's a bummer because it was my dream job. Writing for late night is a lot of people's dream jobs, and they're coming into this and it becomes a nightmare very quickly."</p><p>And if there's one thing we know about Twitter, it's that its users will share their opinions on everything, especially pop culture. With the latest accusations surrounding Fallon, users quickly grabbed their phones to tweet about the situation. One user<a href=#>&nbsp;wrote</a>, "After reading that Rolling Stone Mag expos√© on Jimmy Fallon I can't say I'm surprised. What's with show-hosts with a 'nice-guy' persona being secretly the worst?"</p><p>Another Twitter user specifically pulled from the Rolling Stone article, which mentioned the outlet reached out to 30 more employees who "praised" Fallon's talents, but refused to share "positive things" about working at the show. The user roasted the talk show host,&nbsp;<a href=#>saying</a>, "You know how hard it is to get 30 people to all agree on something? Like 30 current & former staffers all agreed Jimmy Fallon is a s**t person. Ain't nobody went to bat for him lol." While the claims made against Fallon are currently only accusations, it seems Twitter has already made its own judgements about the talk show host and his alleged behavior.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtobX90gY6joKalqWKzorjLqKVmrJ%2BttqR51qippKiclrCmedKcmKeckaF6pbvMmqCnl2Ziv7Ct0q1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
