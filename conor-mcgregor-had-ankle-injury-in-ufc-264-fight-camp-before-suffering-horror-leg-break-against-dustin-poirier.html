We got a scan on it.</p><p>“Did that have a small part to play in weakening it? I don’t know. We were (with a doctor) a couple weeks ago to get a scan on the ankle.</p><p>“There might’ve been something in there.</p><p>“It would seem unusual that a young, healthy, fit man could wrap his foot around an elbow and (break it) without there being something (wrong) there before.</p><p>“You can play those guessing games all day long.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>JOIN SUN VEGAS: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET A FREE £10 BONUS WITH 100s OF GAMES TO PLAY AND NO DEPOSIT REQUIRED</a></strong> (Ts&Cs apply)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mb-graphic-ufc-p4p-rankings.jpeg><p>Kavanagh believes the break happened when Poirier blocked <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McGregor</a>‘s rear teep with his elbow.</p><p>He said: “He throws a leg kick, and then he threw a teep.

I was actually really, really happy.</p><p>“At the 4:30 mark or even the 4:45 mark, everything is gravy.
