Sara Waterman, Senior Aesthetician at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Young LDN</a> tells us: "During various stages of pregnancy it is normal to experience certain physiological changes in the skin due to the marked changes in sex hormones, the immune system and the cardiovascular system. These changes are classified as pregnancy-specific dermatoses. It is also common to experience changes in nails and hair during pregnancy."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I swear by this must-have skincare ingredient to soothe my problem skin – and experts agree" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8754d0d473e8-skincare.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I swear by this must-have skincare ingredient to soothe my problem skin – and experts agree" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I swear by this must-have skincare ingredient to soothe my problem skin – and experts agree</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm 42 and I tried The Ordinary’s TikTok skincare hack - here's my honest opinion" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/66b6151e423a-ordinary-tried-and-tested.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm 42 and I tried The Ordinary’s TikTok skincare hack - here's my honest opinion" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm 42 and I tried The Ordinary’s TikTok skincare hack - here's my honest opinion</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e6goxY7B-yl data-wc=84>The skin expert goes into detail about the skin issues that can flare up during and after pregnancy. These can include hyperpigmentation on the face and body and melasma, also referred to as the 'mask of pregnancy' can appear typically during the second half of pregnancy in up to 70% of women, Sara says, which is "characterised by irregular patches of darker pigment in a symmetrical structure on both sides of the face, with the forehead, temples, lips, and central face most commonly affected."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/94cc6856aa24-kourtney-kardashian-breastfeeding-rocky.jpg><p id=e_Q_ggPuaP data-wc=94>Sara also tells us that during and after pregnancy women can experience melanocytic naevi where existing moles can grow or darken. Other issues can include stretch marks and acne. "Acne in pregnancy is the same as normal acne, the increase in pregnancy hormones&nbsp;and excess sebum is the main culprit," Sara says. "Sebaceous gland activity tends to increase during&nbsp;pregnancy due to the increase of maternal progesterone and androgens in the third trimester." Many women are left with acne even after they have given birth as stress, sleep deprivation, and dehydration can cause acne.</p><p id=eGxk-XcSaAC data-wc=63>Noticing dryness in your skin post-partum is also common, Sara says. "It’s important to continue to take your prenatal or postnatal vitamins along with consuming a balanced diet and moisture daily," she tells us. "Your body’s hormone levels can take as long as six to nine months to return to pre-pregnancy levels." But be assured, the experts say Kourt's post-baby glow is achievable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/01d6af52d545-travis-barker-kissing-son-rocky.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Ingredients to introduce into your post-baby skincare routine</h2><p id=epQyq5AgjTM data-wc=53>Achieving a post-baby glow like Kourt is significantly aided by introducing Vitamin C into your skincare routine, via a serum or cream. It's "a top antioxidant and a wonderful skin protector and brightener. It fights free radial damage to aid skin repair as well as stimulating new collagen and elastin," Sara tells us.</p><p id=eycNkcFrwW data-wc=58>Skin expert <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Rebecca Elsdon</a> from Re/Skin Clinic concurs. She tells us that "recommended ingredients to include in skincare regimes during the post-partum period are Vitamin C, a potent antioxidant to help brighten the skin and address pigmentation. Natural oils such as jojoba oil can help protect and lock in hydration. Ceramides can help maintain a good barrier function."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/afab537afb83-kourtney-kardashian-family-rule-children.jpg><p id=er0uGYL23C data-wc=56>Dr Ross Perry, Medical Director of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Cosmedics</a> skin clinics says: "I advise all my pregnant ladies to wear an SPF of 30 plus even in winter as the fluctuating hormones can make your skin far more sensitive to UV light and cause the hyperpigmentation. It’s equally just as important to be protecting yourself from skin cancer."</p><p id=eKZQqOlI-4I data-wc=67>London-based celebrity facialist <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Donna Ryan</a> also informs us that hyaluronic acid "is excellent for hydration as it helps the skin retain moisture", and niacinamides "can help improve skin texture, brighten the complexion, and reduce the appearance of post-pregnancy pigmentation or acne scars". Meanwhile peptides, small proteins that can help stimulate collagen production, "can be beneficial for reducing the appearance of fine lines and promoting skin firmness postpartum."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34f496f987af-snapinstaapp3420727675924544696122722407295787701299132n1080.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Ingredients to avoid</h2><p id=eu-LIkDM5c_ data-wc=101>Introducing new skincare products after you have a baby can also mean having to ditch some products from your routine until your skin is out of the post-partum period. Rebecca Elsdon says new moms should avoid "retinoids, high concentrations of salicylic acid, and hydroquinone." Dr Ross Perry tells us that this is because "it’s a good idea to use a gentle cleanser twice a day (fragrance-free) as harsher versions are more likely to irritate the skin which can be more sensitive following pregnancy and you can be more prone to acne flare-ups and dryness, again this is due to fluctuating hormones."</p><p id=esjTQIW6Zds data-wc=27>"It’s important to ditch products containing benzoyl peroxide and retinol and opt for more natural products as skin is more sensitive especially if you’re breastfeeding," he adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cbae6a31fa9e-kourt-kardashian-travis.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Skincare practices that can soothe post-baby skin&nbsp;</h2><p id=e6nfX_MrjP9 data-wc=67>There are also practices that you can introduce into your skincare routine after having your baby which will help you to achieve Kourt's fresh look. Donna Ryan tells us that "lack of sleep is common during pregnancy and after having a baby, leading to tired-looking eyes and dark circles. Use a hydrating eye cream or apply cold used tea bags to soothe and refresh the under-eye area."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2b520948550b-kourtney-kardashian-dress.jpg><p id=eqTXN-OcMNlo data-wc=50>She adds: "Consider going to a gua sha facialist who uses gentle techniques to alleviate muscle tension and improve circulation. Safe, hydrating skin treatments can address any dryness or sensitivity. Additionally, antioxidant-rich facials may provide a soothing and rejuvenating experience, helping combat the effects of hormonal changes on the skin."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d4bb3d29b3ec-snapinstaapp39292896014679759473226702914131909618617056n1080.jpg><p id=e_zGOwZiHBGZ data-wc=59>Remember to also not neglect your body in your skincare routine. Apply lashings of body lotion with ingredients like shea and cocoa butter to really nourish the skin. If you can, also use this time as a tiny opportunity for some me-time. <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Elizabeth King, Weleda UK Skin Care Expert&nbsp;</a>reveals her key to nourished skin and a relaxed mother.</p><p id=ekQPBhiWntV data-wc=10><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Beauty resolutions. Are they really worth it? Experts explain&nbsp;</a></p><p id=eXfaexDnEAgm data-wc=68>"When you find yourself weepy and in need of a gentle hug, reach for rose oil," she says. "Following a warm bath (remember not too hot), apply your body oil with long sweeping strokes to your upper arms and chest. Next, using both hands on either side of the spine, and starting as high up the back as you can reach, continue with a full, purposeful stroke down."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGxqaGlshHC8zqyrZpqRl8Zuv8qipWaqn6rBqrrEZqKoraKpu6bFjKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mnLGolafBcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
