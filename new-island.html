As Fuji had recently lost his daughter, <a href=# title="Amber (anime)">Amber</a>, he had been intending to clone her to bring her back to life.</p><p>Though Amber's clone died, as did clones of the <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a> <a href=# title="First partner Pokémon">first partner Pokémon</a>, the clone of Mew, Mewtwo, still young, survived. To calm him after the loss of his friends, he was injected with a substance that would make him forget. Eventually, Mewtwo was mature and fully grown. He sensed the scientists outside of his tube and shattered it to take his first breath. The scientists were thrilled at Mewtwo's existence; however, they did not see Mewtwo as a living being worth respect, but only as the end result of their experiment. Because he had lost its compassion, he destroyed them for their ignorance and was discovered among the burning wreck of the lab by Giovanni, who took him back to <a href=# title="Viridian City">Viridian City</a> to use.</p><p>Eventually, after discovering that Giovanni, too, saw him only as a tool, Mewtwo escaped, destroying Team Rocket's facility near <a href=# title="Pallet Town">Pallet Town</a> and the metal suit that restricted his powers. Returning to New Island, he rebuilt the laboratory and called on the best <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer">Trainers</a> in the land to join him for a challenge, intending to clone their Pokémon and prove that the originals were no match. After seeing <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>'s sacrifice to stop the fighting, though, Mewtwo changed his mind and sent the Trainers home, abandoning New Island once more. When it was last seen, only the <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket trio</a> that follows Ash around remained on the island, which is now completely covered in vegetation and devoid of the palace.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Celestial>Celestial</span></h2><p>New Island appeared in the music video for <a href=# title=Celestial>Celestial</a> by <a href=# title="Ed Sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a>.
