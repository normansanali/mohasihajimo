There isn't a guidebook stating that royals can't have them, but in a family where going out sans stockings elicits gasps, it's not shocking that very few royals have visible tattoos.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a23015698/princess-eugenie-net-worth/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Eugenie" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Princess Eugenie</a>, to our knowledge, is the only major British royal with a visible tattoo, though it's almost always hidden by her hair due to it being super tiny and right behind her ear.</p><img alt="queen elizabeth ii platinum jubilee 2022 national service of thanksgiving" title="Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee 2022 - National Service of Thanksgiving" width=1484 height=1111 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/princess-eugenie-attends-a-national-service-of-thanksgiving-news-photo-1674052791.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's unclear when Eugenie got her tattoo, but it made its grand debut pretty recently—when she attended a National Service of Thanksgiving to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, on June 3, 2022.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, what does the tattoo mean? Eugenie hasn't confirmed the meaning herself, but there's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gawker.com/celebrity/princess-eugenie-got-a-tattoo-to-honor-the-queen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=speculation class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">speculation</a> that she got the tattoo in honor of her grandmother—and that the circle could even represent the Sovereign's Orb, which is a famous symbol of the monarch's power.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img alt="elizabeth ii after her coronation" title="Elizabeth II After Her Coronation" width=2755 height=3535 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-elizabeth-ii-wearing-the-imperial-state-crown-and-news-photo-1674066346.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Hulton Deutsch</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And actually, Eugenie isn't entirely alone in the tattoo department. Lady Amelia Windsor (the Duke of Kent's granddaughter) has several tattoos—though she isn't as high profile in the royal family and therefore doesn't always have to ascribe to the same rules.</p><img alt="serpentine summer party 2018 arrivals" title="Serpentine Summer Party 2018 - Arrivals" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/amelia-windsor-attends-the-serpentine-summer-party-at-the-news-photo-1674053264.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Mike Marsland</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Legend also has it that Prince William wanted a tattoo, but Catherine, Princess of Wales, didn't approve. A sailor who spent time with Wills <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1339945/royal-news-kate-middleton-prince-william-royal-family-tattoo-spt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=revealed class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">revealed</a>, "Lots of the guys on board sport tattoos [and] it was obvious William was fascinated. He asked how painful it was and wanted to know what they thought of his idea for a tattoo across his shoulders. We didn't think he was serious—but he said he was keen to get a large tattoo like the one David Beckham has. He said the only thing stopping him was his girlfriend."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meanwhile, Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter Zara Tindall (a.k.a. Princess Anne's daughter) got her tongue pierced when she was a teen. And she actually gave a brief comment about tattoos while chatting about her husband, Mike Tindall, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.yahoo.com/video/zara-tindall-horrified-daughters-tattoos-120841150.html#:~:text=Zara%20told%20the%20September%20issue,on%20if%20they%20did%20though.%E2%80%9D" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=saying class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">saying</a>, "He absolutely hasn't got a tattoo. I'd also rather one of my daughters came home with a piercing than a tattoo because at least a stud can be removed.
