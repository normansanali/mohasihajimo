Photo / Disney</p><p>Rob Marshall, the director of <i>The Little Mermaid</i> remake, has dismissed <a href=#>rumours that the movie makes a pointed reference to the Princess of Wales</a>.</p><p>One reviewer who saw an advance screening of the film told the <i>New York Post</i> last week that “the film seems to draw a number of subtle yet plausible comparisons between Meghan Markle and Prince Harry and the two lead characters, Ariel (who is black in the new movie) and Prince Eric (who is white)”.</p><p>They pointed out one particular scene that seemed to take a swipe at Kate Middleton.</p><p>“Ariel has sacrificed her voice in order to get to the surface and [meet] Prince Eric. She can’t speak so he tries to guess her name ... His first guess is Diana. His second guess is Catherine, but after [Ariel gives a disgusted] reaction, he [concludes] ‘OK, definitely not Catherine’.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>This line does not appear in the original film, which was released in 1989. Instead, Prince Eric guesses the names Diana, Mildred and Rachel.</p><p>But Marshall insists the scene has nothing to do with the Princess of Wales, telling <i>news.com.au</i> at the film’s Sydney premiere last night that the rumour is “absolutely false”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/Gfcf0lPDpZTW1QTnHGv8bmHaFok=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/KRSQZMBSPNDOTPZQ75SSA2VT5M.jpg"><p>“I don’t know where that came from, that’s the most insane thing. People are hilarious how they just dig and find things. There’s no truth to that whatsoever,” he said.</p><p>Marshall appeared at the premiere with Halle Bailey, who plays Ariel in the film, and Melissa McCarthy, who plays Ursula.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Meghan Markle referenced the original film in 2021 <a href=#>during her bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>, revealing that she identified with the main character amid her own struggles to fit in with the royal family.</p><p>“I was sitting in Nottingham cottage and <i>The Little Mermaid</i> came on,” said Markle.</p><p>“And who as an adult really watches <i>The Little Mermaid</i> but it came on and I was like, ‘Well I’m here all the time I might as well watch this’.</p><p>“And I went, ‘Oh my God, she falls in love with the prince and because of that she loses her voice’.</p><p>“But in the end she gets her voice back.”</p><p>Oprah replies to Markle: “And this is what happened here. You feel like you got your voice back,” to which Markle agreed.</p><p>Later in the interview the Duchess of Sussex told Oprah that <a href=#>her and Harry’s love story</a> was “greater than any fairytale you’ve ever read”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMpaCtrJyaeq6x0aaYopxdmbazscKtpqtloprAsbvNnapmrJ9itq%2B%2FwKecZqORqbJuucidm6WdpKS7br7Upqauql2Wr7S7y66rnqSpYrOiuNKeZoJtiIqVjJe1h4V%2FfYqEhHR%2BuYyLjIxlh4KSew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
