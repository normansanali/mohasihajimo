OK, not really a shocking confession unless you consider how incredibly insensitive and out-of-touch it is. Hence why Cardi B’s post is blowing up today.</p><p data-characters=605 data-current-count=907 data-injectable=true>Cardi responded to a fan’s question on the bird app about her recent video with Latto for the song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Put It On Da Floor Again</a>, which just dropped 15 hours ago and already has over a million views on YouTube. Some people expressed dislike for it since she is seen with her friends waving guns at the camera. Of course, her dear friend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Takeoff</a>, who was a part of the rap group <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Migos</a> with her husband <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Offset</a> (and it turns out is not related to Offset or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Quavo</a> as originally believed), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was shot and killed last year</a>. Thus, having fun with guns in her video in such a way doesn’t seem like the smartest idea.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>That fan on Twitter asked her why she’s posing with guns, and added, “Who escapes the hood just to relive it every chance they get?”</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Cardi B responded that she misses her old life and said, “Sometimes having everything GETS BORING,” though she was sure to add, “but I won’t complain.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>You wanna know wats so crazy ? I was tearing the other day Cause I miss my old life …Sometimes having everything GETS BORING…But I won’t complain it’s not about me anymore. This is part of growing up and bout my kids ..but yea PUT IT ON THE FLOOR !!! <a href=#>https://t.co/0uRkrd1KkO</a></p>— Cardi B (@iamcardib) <a href=#>June 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>Well, a whole lot of people had something to say in response and, funny enough, the comment about being bored of being rich actually overshadowed her strange response to waving guns in the video.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Here are some of the responses after the post was shared by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No Jumper on Instagram</a>. The first two are pretty harsh and unnecessary but, unfortunately, earned more likes than any other response. That last one is much easier to support, however.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6EBCCA23-C3DF-45D8-8FDD-EE158018878D.jpeg><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false><br>Enough of Instagram, let’s switch to the Twitterverse.</p><p data-characters=79 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Here are the two most popular responses to a repost on Twitter of the comments.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I get what she means.

One fan even responded to the original question, suggesting he should only debate people who are in his same tax bracket.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Debate in your tax bracket buddy</p>— #BigMommasHouse #Superstarxxx #Bbwbootyhole (@KnobSlobberz) <a href=#>June 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false>And the most liked response under Cardi B’s original post was someone who decided to take the statement as motivation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Sometimes having everything GETS BORING” I can’t wait to be rich enough and living cushy enough to tweet this 😮‍💨🤞🏾 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jVFEDWVmT9</a></p>— ladidai 📲 gems in link in bio (@ladidaix) <a href=#>June 2, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>Cardi B can probably say anything and have endless supporters, though it can be disappointing to see how someone would publicly express boredom over being rich in a world filled with so many people financially struggling.</p><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Maybe she should just be glad that no one has suggested that the B in Cardi B now stands for “Boring.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1osLIp55mnaaav7rAx6KloGWXmsG0ecGoqaKml2Kwor7DomSbZaKevbGxw2aZsmWWlru0ecWoqWanpal6sLKMraaum5hisLC6xZ6qrKGfo3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
