The actress starred alongside <a href=#><strong>Malese Jow</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jordan Calloway</strong></a> &nbsp;in the Nickelodeon series&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Unfabulous</i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>which aired on the network for three seasons from September 2004 to December 2007. However, they weren’t the only famous faces who appeared on the series.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Nicole Anderson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Miranda Cosgrove</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Bailee Madison</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Tyler Blackburn</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Hayley Kiyoko</a></strong>, among others, had guest-starring roles amid the show’s Nickelodeon run. While most of these celebs have since moved on from their Nickelodeon days, a few — including Emma — look back fondly at their time as child stars.</p><p>“Growing up, I was obsessed with all shows Nickelodeon —&nbsp;Clarissa Explains It All, Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” the American&nbsp;<i>Horror Story </i>alum told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message>PorterEdit</a> in November 2018. “I remember saying to my mom, ‘I want my own show on Nickelodeon one day,’ and she was like, ‘That’s a great dream to have.’ Then when I was 12, I auditioned for a Nickelodeon show and my childhood dream came true.”</p><p>From that point on, she was a star. Now, Emma is a mother of one to son <a href=#>Rhodes with ex-boyfriend <strong>Garrett Hedlund</strong></a> and has a major career under her belt.</p><p>“It’s been really nice to reflect on what I do want to do as an actress,” the Holidate star gushed to&nbsp;<a href=#>MTV News</a> in October 2020. “And now, as I’m about to have a baby, what I spend my time doing work-wise, I want to be much more discerning about, just because it will be taking me away from being a mom.”</p><p>She now has the luxury of picking roles she wants to do. Not to mention, she’s stepping foot behind the camera and producing a few shows with her company&nbsp;Belletrist. In September 2022, her relatable series&nbsp;Tell Me Lies&nbsp;premiered.</p><p>“I think we can see ourselves, we can&nbsp;see our friends,” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> of the show.&nbsp;“I feel like there’s always a time, when you’re young where it’s like, ‘Oh, I should’ve just focused more on myself instead of a guy,’ or you see your friend being like, ‘Why are you so obsessed with that person? Move on?’ And so, I think that that’s something everyone will majorly be able to relate to.”</p><p>Of course, Emma’s not the only&nbsp;Unfabulous star who has been killing it.&nbsp;<strong>S</strong><strong>croll through our gallery to uncover all the stars you totally forgot guest-starred in&nbsp;Unfabulous.</strong></p><p>Love J-14?
