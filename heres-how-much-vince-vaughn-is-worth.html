It's pretty high, which is unsurprising given that, in his glory days, he was one of the world's highest-paid actors. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>,&nbsp;at his peak, he was earning "$15-$20 million per movie," reportedly making $20 million for 2007's&nbsp;Fred Claus&nbsp;and $17 million for&nbsp;The Dilemma.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Forbes</a>, he was even once had one of the highest "Ulitmate Star Paybacks," in other words, bringing in the most money on the lowest budget.

He bought it for $12 million, "the priciest condo sale in Chicago history," per the outlet. Wow! In 2011, he listed the stunner for $24.7 million, which he then dropped to $13.7 million in 2015, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>POP SUGAR</a>.&nbsp;He sold it a year later. Then, in 2018, Vaughn sold his 1950s Traditional-style Hollywood Hills home (which he bought from Kate Bosworth) for nearly $2.5 million, per&nbsp;<a href=#>The Los Angeles Times</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that a Wedding Crashers sequel is in the works (Vaughn confirmed the news to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020), there's a good chance his already impressive net worth will get a big boost soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma29mZ4N2e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZaaeu6SxjK%2BYrp%2BYo3qqv4ywpqusmGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
