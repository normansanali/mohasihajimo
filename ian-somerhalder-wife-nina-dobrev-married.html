Photographers saw them cuddling up in the L.A. Farmers’ Market back then.</p><p>According to bystanders, the couple enjoyed coffee while making love while shopping in Sherman Oaks.</p><p>Although they had known one other for a long time, things between them took a while to get amorous.

She said,</p><p>“I wanted to be professional in the program; I didn’t want to be dating one of my costars. However, there are instances where you have no control over the people you interact with, and you can only fight it for so long—which is exactly what I did for a very, very long time.</p><p>Even though they had chemistry, their romance didn’t last long, and they called it quits in 2013.</p><h2><span id=His_Additional_Former_Relationships>His Additional Former Relationships</span></h2><p>He began dating Kate Bosworth, his co-star in Young Americans, at the beginning of 2000.
