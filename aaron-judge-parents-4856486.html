She was with baseball great Roger Maris when Aaron tied the former Yankee’s record. For the big 62nd record smasher, Aaron and his parents were at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, as he and the Yankees played the Texas Rangers.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Aaron Judge's mom and Roger Maris Jr. reacting to 61 🥺</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>(via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@Yankees</a>)<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/enWrENmTYV</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>— ESPN (@espn) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 29, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>After, Aaron’s mom made it to the locker room to celebrate by giving her boy a big hug.

He <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>raved about her</a> to the press after, explaining, “Having my mom here, it’s important.

The couple, who are both school teachers from Linden, Calif., adopted little Aaron just two days after he was born.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“I feel they kind of picked me,” Aaron told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Post </a>in 2015. “I feel that God was the one that matched us together.”</p><h2>Do They Have Other Kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Aaron also has an older brother named <strong>John,</strong> who is also adopted. The biracial athlete noticed he didn’t resemble his parents when he was around the age of 10. John, 36, lives in Korea and works as a teacher.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>He remembered, “I started asking questions, and they told me I was adopted and answered all my questions, and that was that. I was fine with it. It really didn’t bother me because that’s the only parents I’ve known.”</p><h2>Does Aaron Know His Birth Parents?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Aaron has never had contact with his biological parents. He explained why he has no interest to Newsday in 2017, saying “I have one set of parents, the ones that raised me. That’s how it is. Some kids grow in their mom’s stomach; I grew in my mom‘s heart. She’s always shown me love and compassion ever since I was a little baby. I’ve never needed to think differently or wonder about anything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Aaron-Judge-parents-shutter-embed-2.jpg><h2>Did His Parents Push Him To Play Baseball?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Aaron’s parents knew he had natural talents and supported his athletic skills. “His mother and I just wanted him to be a really good person,” Wayne said. “But we knew from a very young age, as soon as we put a ball in his hand, that he had a lot of natural talent.” He would excel at his high school in Linden, California. In his final two years at Linden High he earned academic and athletic honors in baseball, basketball and football.</p><h2>Were They Hard On Aaron?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>The All-Star said his parents put a lot of pressure on him to achieve. Talking to&nbsp;The Record newspaper shortly after leaving high school in tk, he remembered, “I wanted to go outside and play with my friends or play some video games, but they were tough on me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>“They’d say, ‘Hey, you’ve got homework to do. You’ve got to finish your math homework and science homework. Then if you have time left over before dinner, you can go play. Something like that. I didn’t like it as a kid, but looking back on it, I really appreciate what they did for me.”</p><h2>He Credits Them For Everything</h2><p id=content-paragraph-23>Aaron told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MLB.com</a> that he “wouldn’t be a New York Yankee” without his mom back in 2017. “The guidance she gave me as a kid growing up, knowing the difference from right and wrong, how to treat people and how to go the extra mile and put in extra work, all that kind of stuff,” he said at the time. “She’s molded me into the person that I am today.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CaqaimXZ%2FCpbPEZqeaqpWjwbR5k3Fsb2xoa3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
