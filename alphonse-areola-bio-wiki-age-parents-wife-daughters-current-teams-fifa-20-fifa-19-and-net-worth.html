When Areola was 15, and upon the advice of coaches in Paris, he enrolled at the Clairefontaine football centre in order to further his development. He returned to PSG the following year and signed his first professional contract with the Parisians in July 2009, putting pen to paper on a three-year deal.</p><p>On 18 May 2013, having progressed through the club’s academy, Areola made his senior debut for PSG, replacing first-choice goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu in the 48th minute of a 3–1 home win over Brest. PSG had been crowned Ligue 1 champions prior to the match and their opponents were already relegated. He made his first start for the club the following weekend in a 3–1 win over Lorient, playing 61 minutes in what was the final match of the season before being substituted for fourth-choice ‘keeper Ronan Le Crom, who was sent off later in the match for a foul on Julien Quercia.</p><p>Following his successful stint in Spain, Areola returned to PSG for the 2016–17 Ligue 1 season. He began the campaign as understudy to German keeper Kevin Trapp, who had signed the season before, and was in PSG’s match-day squad for their 4–1 Trophée des Champions victory over Lyon. He made his first appearance following his return on 13 September in a 1–1 Champions League draw with Arsenal, in what was also his debut in the competition.</p><p>Following the match against Arsenal, Areola established himself as PSG’s first-choice goalkeeper and had kept four clean sheets in eight appearances by mid-October. However, he suffered a downturn in form soon after and ultimately relinquished his place to Trapp after a string of matches in December in which he conceded 10 goals from just 11 shots faced.</p><p>In April the following year, he was an unused substitute as PSG beat Monaco 4–1 to claim a record fourth straight Coupe de la Ligue title but started in a 1–0 win over Angers which saw PSG lift the Coupe de France title the following month. The following season, on 29 July 2017, Areola earned his second Trophée des Champions medal when he started in a 2–1 win over Monaco which saw PSG claim their fifth consecutive title.</p><p>He continued the season as PSG’s undisputed goalkeeper in the league and Europe, with Trapp favoured in cup competitions, and was a regular feature in the club’s record-breaking progression through the group stages of the Champions League. With Areola in goal, PSG conceded just once in their opening five matches and scored 24 goals, the most ever by a club in the group stages of the competition.</p><p>On 31 March 2018, in a repeat of the previous seasons’s final, Areola was an unused substitute as PSG retained the Coupe de la Ligue title with a 3–0 win over Monaco. The following month, on 15 April, he started in goal as PSG again defeated Monaco, who were the reigning league champions, 7–1 to claim the Ligue 1 title.</p><p>The club completed a domestic treble on 8 May when they defeated third division side Les Herbiers to lift the Coupe de France trophy for a record fourth consecutive season; though Areola was an unused substitute in the final.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-alphonse-areola></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions about Alphonse Areola</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-alphonse-areola></span><span>Who is Alphonse Areola?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alphonse Areola is an accomplished French Professional Footballer.
