front bottoms Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴This is for the lions living in the wiry broke down frames of my friends bodies When the flood water comes, it ain't gonna be clear It’s gonna look like mud But I will help you swim I will help you swim I'm gonna help you swim This is for the snakes and the people they bite For the friends I’ve made; for the sleepless nights For the warning signs I’ve completely ignored There’s an amount to take, reasons to take more It's no big surprise you turned out this way When they close their eyes and prayed you would change And they cut your hair, and sent you away You stopped by my house the night you escaped With tears in my eyes, I begged you to stay You said, hey man, I love you but no fucking way I’m sure that we could find something for you to do on stage Maybe shake a tambourine or when I sing, you sing harmonies This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in Naked and dumb on a drunken night And it should've felt good But I can hear the Jaws theme song on repeat in the back of my mind Make sure you kiss your knuckles before you punch me in the face There are lessons to be learned, consequences for all the stupid things I say And it is no big surprise you turned out this way The spark in her eyes The look on your face I will not be late I’m sure that we could find something for you to do on stage Maybe shake a tambourine or when I sing you sing harmonies I wanna contribute to the chaos I don’t wanna watch and then complain 'Cause I am through finding blame That is the decision that I have made She hopes I’m cursed forever to Sleep on a twin-sized mattress In somebody’s attic or basement my whole life Never graduating up in size to add another And my nightmares will have nightmares every night Oh, every night, every night <a href=../../../twin-size-mattress.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../who-is-erik-duran-nypd-sergeant-suspended-for-throwing-cooler-at-eric-duprey-who-died-of-injuries.html>Who is Erik Duran?
