I want to take my relationship to the next step, as well. I don’t mind becoming a father. I want to be a young dad.”</strong></p><p>In a video that Spears posted following the engagement, she is seen showing off her new ring, designed by N.Y.C. jeweler Roman Malayev, with the caption, “<strong>I can’t f***ing believe it 💍💍💍💍💍💍❣️!!!!!!”</strong></p><p>It is still unclear when the two plan to walk down the aisle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Does Sam Asghari Do For His Living?</h2><p>Britney Spears’ boyfriend, Sam Asghari, is a personal trainer. According to their site, the fitness guru is the owner and founder of Asghari Fitness, a members-only program that provides clients with a personalized diet and workout plans.</p><p>Asghari’s plan begins at $9 per week, which amounts to around $468 per year per client. It’s not clear how large Asghari’s client base is, but with over 21,000 <a href=#>followers on Instagram</a>, we imagine it’s large enough to make him a generous salary each year. But this is not the only way Asghari has made his money.</p><p>While Asghari is not a direct beneficiary of Britney Spears’ conservatorship, he has worked with the singer in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>The workout junkie is also a professional model, actor, and dancer—and in October 2016, he met Britney while playing the love interest in her “Slumber Party” music video.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple started dating soon after. Since then, Asghari has appeared in TV drama NCIS, Showtime comedy series Black Monday, and HBO’s Hacks, among others, while working on his fitness company.</p><p>After Asghari and Spears announced their engagement in September 2021, many fans grew concerned that Spears might be taken advantage of financially unless she entered into a prenuptial agreement with her husband-to-be.&nbsp;</p><p>Asghari put fans’ concerns to rest in an Instagram Story at the time, confirming that he and Britney will sign an “iron-clad prenup.” He also joked that the legal document protected his “jeep and shoe collection” rather than her assets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sam Asghari Net Worth</h2><p>Sam Asghari’s net worth is calculated to be $2 million.
