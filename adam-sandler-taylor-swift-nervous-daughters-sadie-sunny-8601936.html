Speaking to O'Brien about situations that left him completely speechless, Sandler said that he gets nervous around Swift because Sadie and Sunny are big fans and he doesn't want to embarrass them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Taylor Swift, because what she means to my kids, I get it a little fucking jumpy," Adam said. "I don't want to blow it for my kids — I talk a little too loud. I don't act as cool as I can."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's this whole other level," Conan added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So many smash hits. There's not a word my kids don't know — I know ‘em too, by the way! But they know them inside and out," Adam added. "Remember The Beatles? Every fucking song on the record you knew? That's Taylor Swift, too. There's not a song you skip."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Rodin Eckenroth/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sandler's status as a Swiftie is well-documented. Back in October, he and Sunny&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>performed a cover of Swift's "Lover"</a>&nbsp;during his tour. He also attended the red carpet premiere of the Eras Tour movie. Sandler's love of his kids isn't a secret, either. During his acceptance speech at this year's People's Choice Awards, he gave his daughters a sweet shoutout.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My daughters, Sadie and Sunshine," Adam said while accepting the People's Icon Award in February. "Not a minute goes by without me thinking of and how much I love you, you're my best friends and my darling wife Jackie, you are my partner for life. I love every car ride and every kiss we've ever had, forever and ever my girl."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wJ2YpmWjlruluMSrZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2jsrPCzq6qZpyRqrSpwMSrqmarkZm2pnnSrqWnsV1tg3F9mGxt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
