She was Naia Sheffield before she tied the knot with the player. The lady is interested in horses and seems to have been involved in horse race betting with her late husband.</p><p>Furthermore, the athlete’s wife was completely unaware of his drug abuse when he was arrested by the cops in the past.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=jeremy-giambi-kids><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeremy-giambi-kids></span> Jeremy Giambi Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeremy Giambi and his wife were often depicted playing with the little kids of their brother and sister.

He and his brother Jason are from my hometown. When they made it to the big leagues, I was always so proud to tell everyone that the Giambi brothers were from West Covina, CA.

He was at his parental house in California when the bitter event took place. Well, it was well known that he was into anabolic steroids for a long period of his life.</p><p>The outfielder might have been through a mental struggle in recent.
