Dannielynn donned a bright blue Jovani suit which she perked up with a feathered fascinator.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e458336077b6bdec07e1de5d9bc7b710.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Anna Nicole Smith on the Set of Kanye West's Video "Workout Plan" at North Hills Gym in North Hills, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Dannielynn's bright purple camisole added some flare to her color combination.

He rocked a bright purple suit, a sky-blue undershirt, and dark blue brogues. Her star dad let fans know why they were dressed up as he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/COTnfRrFUlR/>captioned</a> the post:</p><p class=dh>"It's that time of the year again.

He relayed that Dannielynn's choice signified that she was no longer a little girl who preferred little dresses.</p><p class=dh>Dannielynn's fashion style was further established with a bejeweled face mask showing off in the other photos shared. The last slide also presented Larry's fashion range, showing him in an immaculate white suit.</p><p class=dh>It is safe to say that Dannielynn got her top-notch sense of style from her late mom. During her lifetime, Smith was famous for being one of Playboy Playmates. She possessed a knack for the modeling world, and it paid off.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Smith</a> was a Texas town girl, but she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/personality/anna-nicole-smith>sought fame</a> like that of Marilyn Monroe. After sending some of her explicit photos to Playboy's email, she gained fame, and that was a stepping stone.</p><p class=dh>Once speaking about the dynamics of the life Smith lived, Larry mentioned that it was as though she possessed two <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://abcnews.go.com/US/cameras-off-anna-nicole-smith-vicki-lynn-friends/story?id=75642872">separate personalities</a>.
