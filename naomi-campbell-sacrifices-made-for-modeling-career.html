She also spoke on the sacrifices she's had to make while being a trailblazer for Black models.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'd say the sacrifice is really finding that soul mate who will understand you," Campbell told the outlet. "It's really like you feel if they look at you as if you're strong … you know, I'm strong, but I'm also sensitive. I know that in relationships I have to compromise."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Campbell has been public with some of her previous relationships, including those with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore and British rapper Skepta.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When considering the past, Campbell acknowledged her personal growth since the '90s and 2000s, when she was frequently accused of violence and misuse of power. "I don't have a problem looking at myself in the mirror anymore and facing and owning who I am. And for sure when I was younger, I wasn't always using it in the right way. It takes growth.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Surrounded by a strong support system, Campbell said that she was grateful for her longtime friendships and her mother—the latter of which Campbell became herself when she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36461082/naomi-campbell-first-child/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="welcomed her daughter" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">welcomed her daughter</a> last May.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm not out here on my own," she told The Cut. "It's simple, and it's small. To be with your loved ones who just want to enjoy quality time. I want my friends to flourish. You want to protect those you love. And most importantly, when I reach out to people, and I need help and understanding and guidance, it's important for me to remember to say 'Thank you.' Almost like a threat—'You never know when you may need that person to help you again or guide you.'"<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The model also expressed her gratitude for the Black community and her fans who have embraced her since the early days of her career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am grateful to God that my culture embraces me and protects me. My people support me. And defend me. And I do feel, especially in the past few years, I've really felt that when people or publications—just newspapers, really—have come at me with an angle that before, I'd have to be out there trying to [defend myself]—well, I never really did justify myself with newspapers, to be honest. But now, I don't have to say a word."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
