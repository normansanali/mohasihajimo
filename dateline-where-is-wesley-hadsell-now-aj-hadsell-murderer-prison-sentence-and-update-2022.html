In a new episode titled “Jacket,” “Dateline” highlights the homicide case.</strong></p><p>This Friday’s “Dateline” episode, titled “The Jacket,” will have Andrea Canning report on the disappearance and murder case of Anjelica “AJ” Hadsell on NBC at 10:00 p.m. ET.</p><p>According to the Norfolk Police Department, the 18-year-old Longwood University student unexpectedly vanished while visiting her parents’ house in Tarlton, Norfolk, during her spring break in March 2015. Her corpse was discovered half-buried at a deserted site in Southampton County only around five weeks later.</p><p>The victim’s stepfather, Wesley Hadsell, was identified as a suspect in Angelica’s murder after GPS located his movements. A jury convicted him of first-degree murder and concealment of the deceased corpse earlier this year, nearly seven years after the crime. For the second time, Wesley was charged with murder.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dateline-aj-hadsell-murderer-wesley-hadsell-is-sentenced-to-life-in-prison></span>Dateline: AJ Hadsell Murderer Wesley Hadsell Is Sentenced To Life In Prison<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wesley Hadsell, AJ’s adopted father or stepfather, was suspected of being personally engaged in the crime very immediately.</p><p>Wesley was found guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of AJ in February. In April, he was&nbsp;sentenced&nbsp;to life in prison, with the court describing his actions as the cruelest, most terrible conduct one can imagine.</p><p>AJ went missing, and her body was discovered on an abandoned property in Southampton County about a month later. Investigators tracked down her body by looking through Wesley Hadsell’s work van’s GPS data.</p><p>Anjelica “AJ” Hadsell, then 18 years old, vanished from Norfolk, Virginia on March 2, 2015. She disappeared during spring break of her freshman year while visiting her parents’ residence.</p><p>When the news of her abduction initially emerged, it was stated that she was last seen by a neighbor driving away from her mother’s Millard Street home in a vehicle. Her corpse was discovered half-buried in a drainage ditch behind an abandoned property in Southampton County, near the North Carolina border, five weeks later.</p><p>An acute heroin overdose, along with homicidal violence, was the cause of death for 18-year-old Anjelica, according to the medical examiner’s findings. Her chin and eyes were blackened and injured, and the amount of heroin in her system was three times the deadly amount.</p><p>The examiner was unable to determine if she had been sexually assaulted due to the damage inflicted on her body by animals and insects.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wesley-hadsell-age-disclosed></span>Wesley Hadsell Age Disclosed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wesley Hadsell’s age in 2022 is<strong>&nbsp;45 years old</strong>. In the March 2015 killing of stepdaughter Angelica “AJ” Hadsell, he was convicted of first-degree murder and concealing her body.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-was-wesley-hadsell-motive-behind-the-murder></span>What Was Wesley Hadsell Motive Behind The Murder?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to the&nbsp;commonwealth, the murder might have been sexually motivated.</p><p>The corpse of the victim was discovered weeks after she vanished in Norfolk, behind an abandoned house in Southampton County. Her death was attributed to a heroin overdose by the medical examiner. Prosecutors think that after kidnapping AJ, Hadsell bought heroin from his drug dealer and compelled her to inject it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyRqbKttc2eZLCglaeybrXSZq6eq5yaxm60wJ2qnqScYruww4yaoWagkZnAprjLZqSuqpSav6a%2BjKmpoqufo3q0sc2tnKeblWKur7CMrqedmaSaenN8kWtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
