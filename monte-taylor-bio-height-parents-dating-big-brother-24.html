But little do they do about his mechanical engineering degree, the books that he read, and things of that nature.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This Monte Taylor Bio will explore the secrets behind this hunk of a man.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Monte Taylor On Big Brother 24</b></h3><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Big Brother </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>season 24 premiered on July 6, 2022, and as always there appeared 16 contestants including Monte Taylor fighting for that stunning $500,000 cash prize. So, a brand new season meant a brand new set of dramas and shenanigans. And our star, Monte was well prepared for it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to him, Monte would ally with people who were trustworthy and loyal. “So if what’s talked about within the alliance stays within the alliance, then that’ll make sure that we can advance our game even further,” he explained. And if there was one thing that got on his nerves, it was chatty people “who like to talk a lot about the things that you’ve said in private to others.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Guess, Monte wasn’t having many friends. Also, another thing, other house guests may dislike about him was the fact that he is very positive. He didn’t like to get into any drama or entertain a lot of that stuff. Moreover, he also kept his cards pretty close to my chest, so he didn’t share too much. But then again, he didn’t plan on sharing too much about how he felt about certain situations just to stay out of the mix on a lot of things.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Overall, his game plan was to just be himself. “I plan on doing that throughout this whole summer, not altering or changing who I am. Because that’s going to be the best version of me,” he added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>All excited to see himself on the show, Monte took it to his IG to share, “Want to see more of Monte?! Tune in this week to CBS to watch Monte on Biiiiiiiig Brother.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, Monte was already up for elimination in the first week, but that didn’t mean he didn’t have a chance.</span></p><h3><b>Is Monte Taylor Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Monte wasn’t dating anyone when he entered the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Big Brother</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> house.
