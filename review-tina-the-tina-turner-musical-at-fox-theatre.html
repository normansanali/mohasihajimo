Like Turner, Villanueva at times seems to <i>chew </i>on her lyrics. Tenderness, though she may have longed for it in her personal life, was never Turner’s terrain. She finds her power in nasality, gutsiness and grit.</p><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Matthew Murphy for MurphyMade</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/things-to-do/review-tina-the-tina-turner-musical-at-fox-theatre/5J7TTOJLSFFOBK6RLR6CE2DA2Q/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Matthew Murphy for MurphyMade</p><p class=story-text data-index=12>As Ike Turner, Garrett Turner packs toxic brutality under the affected mannerisms of a showman, high on cocaine. His behavior shocks us, just as Tina’s father’s did. Ike is as vicious as a snake — even his wardrobe has a reptilian sheen. Such is his ability to slither and seduce that Tina’s mother (played by the wonderful Roz White) takes his side until the bitter end, by which I mean from her own deathbed.</p><p class=story-text data-index=13>Tina’s journey — her relationships with family members, suitors and business partners, including Phil Spector (Geoffrey Kidwell), Roger Davies (Zachary Freier-Harrison) and Erwin Bach (Max Falls) — is long and winding. As is often the case with jukebox musicals, this treatment (book is by Atlanta playwright Katori Hall, Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins) goes for epic highs and lows, yet after the big moments — the rejections, the overdosing, the financial ruin — we don’t feel much of the icon’s inner complexity.</p><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Matthew Murphy for MurphyMade</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/things-to-do/review-tina-the-tina-turner-musical-at-fox-theatre/5J7TTOJLSFFOBK6RLR6CE2DA2Q/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Matthew Murphy for MurphyMade</p><p class=story-text data-index=15>As Turner’s journey peaks and troughs, we revisit the young Anna-Mae (the lovely Aniya Simone), in a scene in which she performs the David Bowie-Iggy Pop classic “Tonight.” A number that’s perhaps intended to wipe away the tears and imbue us with hope, it feels a bit heavy-handed. Rather than tugging at the heartstrings, it made me cringe.</p><p class=story-text data-index=16>“Tina” is nothing if not a big, splashy Broadway spectacle, a status that is backed up by some top-notch design. Whereas Mark Thompson’s sets tend to be minimal (a doorway, a bed, a sofa), his sexy, shimmering costumes are anything but. Bruno Poet helps tell the story with his sensitive lighting, and Jeff Sugg’s projections, by turns hallucinogenic and mod, are pure eye candy, an ideal backdrop for a musical landscape that encompasses church music, soul, R&B, disco and rock.</p><p class=story-text data-index=19>This is an imperfect show with a near-perfect songbook. After near tragedy, Tina triumphs. She is, to put it plainly, simply the best.</p><h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20">THEATER REVIEW</h2><p class=story-text data-index=24><b>“Tina: The Tina Turner Musical”</b></p><p class=story-text data-index=25>Through Sunday. 7:30 p.m. Wednesday-Thursday. 8 p.m. Friday. 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Saturday. 1 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Sunday. $39-$99.
