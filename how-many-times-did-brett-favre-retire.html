This decision came after 16 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, during which he solidified his status as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.&nbsp;</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Favre's retirement announcement was an emotional moment for both himself and his fans, as it marked the end of an era in Green Bay.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The First Comeback</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>However, Favre's retirement was short-lived. In the summer of 2008, he expressed a desire to return to football. This led to a dramatic saga involving Favre and the Green Bay Packers, ultimately resulting in his reinstatement to the NFL. His return, not with the Packers but with the New York Jets, marked the first of several comebacks in his career.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Second Retirement</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>After a season with the New York Jets, Favre retired for the second time in early 2009.

However, as history would soon reveal, this retirement was also not destined to be permanent.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Second Comeback</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In the summer of 2009, Brett Favre once again announced his return to the NFL, this time with the Minnesota Vikings.
