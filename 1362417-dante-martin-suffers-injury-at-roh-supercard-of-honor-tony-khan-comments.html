The bout included the Lucha Brothers, The Kingdom, Aussie Open, Top Flight, and La Faccion Ingobernable. In the closing minutes of the bout. Penta El Zero Miedo hit a destroyer on Dante Martin through a table, and the Top Flight member landed awkwardly on his ankle. Martin was taken out of the bout as he was stretchered to the back.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>During the post-show press conference, Tony Khan was asked for an update following Martin’s apparent injury. Khan stated that Martin was at the hospital, and he noted that the fan-favorite star could be out for some time.</p><p>“He’s at the hospital right now, and right before I came out here, I talked to Darius, and Darius is there, and some other good friends are there. I hope to have a good update soon on Dante. I know he’s in pain, but I’m wishing the best, and obviously we’re all praying for Dante’s an amazing wrestling.</p><p>“Obviously, his brother has been through serious injuries and missed time, and we love Darius very much too, and we missed Darius when he was out, and I think Dante will probably be out of action for some time, and look forward to now Darius taking the time to grow and learn from it. But Dante is somebody who is gonna be with us for a very, very, very long time, and I care very much about Dante and have gotten to know him a long time since he came up with us through the pandemic. That one hurt a lot of people in the back, including myself, but it hurt nobody worse than poor Dante, and I just hope he’s gonna be okay.”</p><p>Martin is also signed to AEW, and he frequently competes for the company.</p><p>WrestleZone will provide more information as it becomes available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJvaW1pZ2KxorrTnmSmmaKptq950q6dn52iqHqqusmuqbJlkal6s7vHZqquqJWnsKK%2Bw2amn2WYpLuwvoytpqexXaC1orqMnKampZWjwbQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
