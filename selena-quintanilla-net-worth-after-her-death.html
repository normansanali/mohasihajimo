Despite the fact that she passed away in 1995, Selena Quintanilla-Pérez's legacy lives on through her music and, most recently, a Netflix series about her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the late star's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">husband has specific thoughts on the 'Selena' series</a>, fans are grateful that Netflix became so invested in reinvigorating the singer's life story. After all, she changed music for multiple generations; Tom Brokaw, when reporting on her murder, called Selena "the Mexican Madonna."</p><p>And while her death was tragic, the fact that fans were so dedicated to her memory is what has kept her estate growing since the late '90s. Similar to the way Michael Jackson's passing led to more album sales than he had during his lifetime, so Selena Quintanilla's net worth has continued to increase after her death.</p><h2 id=what-was-selena-s-net-worth-when-she-died>What Was Selena's Net Worth When She Died?</h2><p>Fans of Quintanilla will remember that the story of her rise to fame was almost a rags-to-riches story. While her father was often villanized for his part in pushing the Quintanilla children into the spotlight, the truth is that Selena y Los Dinos weren't really rich at first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It took time to build up a fan following, and of course, the biggest breakthrough came when Selena's personality really took over the stage.</p><p>But although some records suggest that Selena had made a few million dollars before her death in 1995, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">probate documents</a> confirmed that her net worth was $164,000 at the time of her demise. That's roughly the equivalent of $280K in 2021, so not much for a woman who was becoming a superstar.</p><p>But as fans know, her net worth continued ticking upward in the years since, adding value to her estate and, consequently, her family's net worths as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-selena-s-husband-s-net-worth>What Is Selena's Husband's Net Worth?</h2><p>One of the things fans have wondered about is Selena's husband's net worth. Chris&nbsp;Pérez was understandably devastated to lose his wife, and he apparently didn't put up much of a fight when Selena's father decided to take over her estate.</p><p>Publications seemed to paint Abraham Quintanilla as a bad guy from day one, and it's evident that he intended to maximize the profits despite the loss of his daughter. Shortly after Selena's passing, Abraham agreed to a film about Selena's life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Fans Call Out Netflix For Mistreating ‘Selena: The Series’ Creators And Disrespecting The Late Singer’s Legacy" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Call Out Netflix For Mistreating ‘Selena: The Series’ Creators And Disrespecting The Late Singer’s Legacy</a></span></p><p>And Chris, Selena's devoted husband? He just wanted to keep playing music. Apparently, he even allowed Abraham to take over Selena's estate, saying, "Why should I worry about losing something? I have already lost what I always wanted. I would trade everything I had if I could have her back."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At one point, however, it was noted that Chris&nbsp;Pérez was to receive 25 percent of the profits of Selena's estate. The agreement, which was reportedly arranged by Selena's father, doesn't seem to have amounted to much, unfortunately.</p><p>As of 2021, Chris is worth a reported $1M, though sources tend to disagree. Some say that&nbsp;Pérez is worth closer to $2M, while Abraham has claimed he paid more than $3M to&nbsp;Pérez over the years.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-selena-s-father-worth>How Much Is Selena's Father Worth?</h2><p>Though Abraham Quintanilla oversees his deceased daughter's estate, not every deal pads his own pockets. Sources suggest that Quintanilla is worth around $5 million, but there's no evidence to suggest that the figure includes what's currently held in Selena's trust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Twitter Fans Remember Selena Quintanilla Perez, 26 Years After Her Passing" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Fans Remember Selena Quintanilla Perez, 26 Years After Her Passing</a></span></p><p>But, there&nbsp;is evidence to suggest Abraham has used Selena's legacy to support his other children's careers. A.B. Quintanilla -- Abraham III -- is famous in his own right, diving into a career in cumbia following his stint in Selena y Los Dinos.</p><p>A.B. often speaks about his sister in the media, he's written songs about her, and he even has a large tattoo of her face. Quintanilla's last album came out in 2017, and he's currently worth about $5 million.</p><h2 id=how-has-selena-quintanilla-s-net-worth-grown-since-her-death>How Has Selena Quintanilla's Net Worth Grown Since Her Death?</h2><p>While her brother has helped keep her memory alive, so has the rest of Selena's family. And the payoff from those efforts is definitely monetary. The family continues to promote merchandise based on Selena's likeness (including Selena Barbie dolls, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clothing in the singer's iconic style</a>, and more), and the estate continues to grow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, Selena's sister, Suzette Quintanilla, is listed as an executive producer on the 'Selena: The Series' show. Clearly, the entire family works together and earns together.</p><h2 id=what-would-selena-s-net-worth-be-today>What Would Selena's Net Worth Be Today?</h2><p>Though it's unclear exactly how much money her estate has earned, and possibly disbursed to the family, questions still circulate about Selena Quintanilla's net worth today. Given her family's current net worths, it makes sense that Selena may very well have a net worth of around $5 million, in terms of what the trust in her name is valued at.</p><p>And yet, Selena's name is still big business, and there's no telling what ideas her family may still have for keeping her memory and her brand alive.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Netflix Fans Are Freaking Out Over Beyoncé's Meeting With Selena" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix Fans Are Freaking Out Over Beyoncé's Meeting With Selena</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqSVo65uvdSipa2Znp65ra2Mp5ytZaekv7W0jJqdrZ2iYrWmvoydnJqsmGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
