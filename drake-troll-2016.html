But the Toronto rapper has done some serious trolling this year, too. From that time he had us convinced that he was dating Taylor Swift, to the not-so-subtle hints that he's involved with Jennifer Lopez, see how Drizzy played us in 2016.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="article-sub-title css-1ooignj emevuu60">1. When He Teased His Album with Cryptic Symbols and Logos (And Then Changed the Title)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before officially announcing his new album, Drake dropped major clues about his upcoming project around the world—literally. In February, during All-Star Weekend, the rapper put up a massive billboard (which later became a running trend for him) reading "VIEWS" in the city of Toronto. Similar ads previewing the project, then known as Views from the 6, were also seen in the airport and later, <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.nme.com/news/music/drake-74-1194866 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="in London" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">in London</a> too. Then he had a brief Kanye moment and made an impromptu edit to the album title, deleting "From the 6" from the name before the LP dropped at the end of April.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="article-sub-title css-1ooignj emevuu60">2. When He Memed Himself</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Views finally did release, the internet, knowing no limits as usual, instantly turned the cover art into a meme. Soon the tiny image of Drake atop the CN tower was photoshopped over everything from other celebrities' heads to the Seinfeld diner. Drake, however, played along on Instagram, proving he gets the last laugh.</p><img alt="Face, Nose, Mouth, Hairstyle, Skin, Eyebrow, Eyelash, Fender, Black hair, Logo, " title="Face, Nose, Mouth, Hairstyle, Skin, Eyebrow, Eyelash, Fender, Black hair, Logo, " width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482967554-hbz-drake-meme-comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Drake/Instagram</span></p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="article-sub-title css-1ooignj emevuu60">3.

The Raptors fan was a vocal addition to the floor seats, who isn't afraid to argue with the refs or taunt opposing players, providing the Internet with viral content along the way.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="article-sub-title css-1ooignj emevuu60">4.

Sources claimed the two flirted at his 30th birthday party and were reportedly spending time together afterwards, though neither artist commented on their supposed romance. But because he has no chill, Drake posted a mysterious photo of himself and Swift from the celebration to pique the rumor mill once more.</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="article-sub-title css-1ooignj emevuu60">7. When Those Dating Rumors Just Resulted in a Music Collab and Parody Video</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It turns out, Drake and Taylor were hanging out because they're <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a18516/taylor-swift-drake-dating-rumors-collaborating/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="collaborating on some new music" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">collaborating on some new music</a>, which surprised fans just as much as the romance gossip did.
